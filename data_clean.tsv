1	neg	During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly	
1	neg	I will not purchase another one of these	
1	neg	The price is not worth it at all with the click issue	
1	neg	To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks	
1	neg	However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity	
2	neg	I will never buy a logitech product again	
3	neg	This thing is one of the heaviest mice I've used for an extended period of time	
3	neg	- Not a truly "safe" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it's worth mentioning	
3	pos	The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse	
3	pos	The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:- Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands	
3	pos	- Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other 'premium' around this price point or even a bit higher	
3	pos	-  Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse	
3	pos	Feels satisfying to use	
3	pos	- Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life	
4	neg	Scroll wheel broke within the first week and now it freewheels like fidget spinner	
5	neg	i frequently hit extra buttons on the mouse and the thumb button makes me hold the entire mouse in a uncomfortable way	
5	pos	the laser and accuracy is the best ive touched ever	
6	pos	The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502	
6	pos	Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner	
6	pos	However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable	
6	pos	The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism	
6	pos	this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is	
6	pos	Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL	
6	pos	Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way	
6	pos	I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502	
6	pos	You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for	
7	neg	LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE	
7	neg	) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode	
7	neg	) Free wheel mouse mode can be sensitive to twitch gaming	
7	pos	) Improved braided cable over previous G502 model	
7	pos	fits my hand fairly well	
7	pos	) LIGHTSYNC added to this model is cool for custom rigs & lighting	
7	pos	) Fully customizable RGB LED, you can set color, cycle speed & mode indicators	
7	pos	) VERY VERY accurate mouse, 4,000 DPI higher than previous 12,000 DPI 502 model	
7	pos	16,000 DPI is insane resolution tbh	
7	pos	) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements	
7	pos	I need to be highly accurate in my video, photography & gaming life, all the G502 series mice have enhanced my computer work & play	
7	pos	they still work perfectly and remain accurate	
7	pos	Seriously this mouse brought my K/D up to new highs, it's so much better than the $100 cordless laser I'm still kind of in shock	
7	pos	Using this for websites, photo editing & detail alignments in Adobe is a dream come true	
7	pos	DON'T FORGET IT's EVEN GOT MACROS	
7	pos	FINAL NOTE: My first G502 is still rock solid even after years of abuse, nothing has failed	
8	neg	they get the infamous double click issue	
8	neg	The bad:- Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react	
8	neg	- On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all	
8	neg	- Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it	
8	neg	The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way	
8	neg	- Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding	
8	pos	The good:- It is a nice looking mouse from outside	
9	neg	The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel	
9	neg	It just sucks	
9	neg	And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel	
9	neg	The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile	
9	neg	At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time	
9	neg	The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound	
9	neg	A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement	
9	neg	However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach	
9	neg	You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused	
9	pos	Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED	
9	pos	The new hero sensor is also awesome	
10	neg	It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly	
10	neg	Shame on you Logitech :(	
11	neg	I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000	
11	neg	My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click	
11	pos	Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything	
12	neg	I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches	
12	neg	It's not worth my time and or money of sending this back and forth	
13	neg	The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times	
14	neg	But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO	
14	neg	There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem	
14	neg	When you click, it double clicks	
14	neg	It's very frustrating and annoying	
14	neg	Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working	
14	neg	Not the typical double click problem though	
14	neg	Mine can't register a click+hold for long	
14	neg	It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc	
14	neg	It won't work	
14	neg	It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem	
14	neg	All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click	
14	neg	The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke	
14	neg	That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general	
14	neg	Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that	
14	neg	It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands	
14	neg	Don't buy this mouse	
14	pos	It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too	
15	neg	Having said that, from a quality aspect it is a pile of flaming trash	
15	neg	Both have the exact same problem where the left mouse button starts double-clicking for any presses after about 3 months of use and therefore holding the mouse button does not work	
15	pos	In the short period of time it actually works it is wonderful	
17	neg	Cons:- I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button)	
17	neg	It's kind of loud	
17	neg	Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500	
17	pos	Pros:- Since the weights are customizable, I still get to have the nice heavy mouse I've always loved	
17	pos	- Still ergonomic as ever	
17	pos	- The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem	
18	neg	The mouse went directly into the trash bin	
19	neg	Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle	
19	neg	I'll never buy a Logitech product again	
19	neg	Don't buy this	
19	neg	You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed	
19	neg	The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem	
19	neg	The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on	
19	neg	The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it	
19	neg	The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly	
19	neg	It just stops	
19	neg	Very frustrating	
19	pos	Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least	
20	neg	The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working	
20	neg	Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible	
20	neg	Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users	
21	neg	Update:  I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab	
21	neg	The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use	
21	neg	Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase	
21	neg	This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade	
21	neg	Update 3:  Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star	
21	pos	This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair	
21	pos	The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired	
21	pos	It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming	
21	pos	Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars	
22	neg	Now for the dislikes, and there are many	
22	pos	You can adjust the weight to your preference and it fits nicely in your hand	
22	pos	Light effects are cool and you can customize the logo if you download the free Logitech software	
23	neg	Cons:- Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip	
23	neg	- There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference)- Mouse is heavy, even without the weights	
23	neg	If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams	
23	neg	- Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review	
23	pos	Pros:- Solid construction- good button placement- buttons are light, and crisp- Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub	
23	pos	Conclusion: This is a well priced product	
23	pos	The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie)	
23	pos	It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip	
24	neg	But the Chinese Omron switches Logitech puts in this mouse are terrible, and Logitech knows it	
24	neg	Within two months of my original purchase, I began experiencing the dreaded double click issue, and quickly opened a ticket with Logitech support	
24	neg	Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements	
24	neg	Which is a terrible shame because I love almost everything about it, but a mouse that cannot click things as intended is not a mouse worth paying for	
24	pos	The design and ergonomics of this mouse are outstanding	
24	pos	All the buttons are placed perfectly, the freewheeling ability of the scroll wheel makes traversing long web pages or documents incredibly easy	
24	pos	Even the companion software doesn't give me that much to complain about	
26	neg	TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use	
26	neg	My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured	
26	neg	It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down	
27	neg	Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled	
27	neg	What's wrong with this new G502	
27	neg	Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with	
27	neg	Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again	
28	neg	The right click will not work correctly when held down which, in a fps game, has caused a ton of issues	
28	neg	The buttons for the dpi switch are a seamless transition to the left click which will cause you to accidentally change your dpi in intense situations	
28	neg	The fact that it died in only 7 months is terrible	
28	pos	The mouse has a very lightweight feel which is great and the cable is a braided material which is a nice touch	
29	neg	The mouse started double clicking a few months after first use (like 2 or 3 months)	
29	neg	It double click 90% of the time and it also decides to move a few centimeters every now on then on its own	
30	neg	Mouse is double clicking on its own, when I mean to single click	
30	neg	Overall, I feel like this mouse is not worth the money at all, I paid less than half for off brand mouse with better quality and longer lifespan (~2 years before being replaced by this one)	
31	neg	The ghost click/double click issue has affected my original purchase, and the replacement, and I expect it to affect any additional replacements issued	
32	neg	When I place my hand how it most naturally fits on the mouse, the extra buttons are out of reach	
32	neg	When I put my whole hand on the mouse (so that the top of my palm touches), my fingers extend over the extra buttons so I have to awkwardly press them with my joints	
32	neg	Ultimately what I'm looking for in a mouse  is comfort during use and I did not find it here	
32	pos	The profile feature of the mouse is nice, with different sets of DPI adjustments for switching between shooters and casual browsing	
33	pos	) The G502 is perfect	
33	pos	It's hefty, and you can customize it using the weights	
33	pos	The button placement is nearly perfect (I find the thumb button a tad hard to reach for my hands) and, like the Pro, the Hero engine is incredibly accurate and satisfying to use	
33	pos	I've ended up using it as my all day mouse, even for work, as it's just so pleasant in the hand	
33	pos	If you're looking for a great mouse at a very reasonable price point, give the G502 a try	
34	neg	Edit to review:After just a few months, both right and left mouse clickers are malfunctioning	
34	pos	This mouse is fantastic	
34	pos	It's sturdy, it's comfortable, the laser is amazing and never skips around	
34	pos	I own both and they are both fantastic	
36	neg	I believe this is an ongoing (YEARS) issue with Logitech and their particular buttons	
36	neg	This was my last Logitech purchase	
36	neg	I have a much cheaper mouse (Redragon, with less buttons) that has taken way more abuse than this mouse and still works perfectly	
36	pos	It has buttons place where they are easily used "reachable" and worked pretty well for what I intended	
38	pos	The program that comes with this mouse is foreign at first, but in the end, gets simple to use	
38	pos	I personally dont like the looks, but the utility of this mouse, makes me love the heck out of this	
38	pos	If you are looking for the best under $50 gaming mouse, this has to the the top pick in my opinion	
38	pos	Do yourself a favor when you buy this mouse - learn it, and learn about all the different things you can do it with	
38	pos	Trust me its worth knowing the hundreds of different configs and things you can do with this mouse and the program together	
39	pos	So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM	
39	pos	This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning	
39	pos	Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces	
39	pos	This mouse can do it, so problem solved	
39	pos	This mouse allows balancing with weights	
39	pos	The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate	
40	neg	Two have failed on me in under a year	
40	pos	Logitech fits my hand better	
40	pos	I prefer to just change dpi and the LED	
41	neg	But there is one flaw in the design of the G502 for me	
41	neg	the speed of movement (DPI setting) button for "faster" is located so close to the left click button that I am consantly tripping it accidentally as I work	
41	neg	Suddenly, the cursor is flying across the screen so fast I can't find it and I have to stop and hit the "slower" button to return to the speed I want	
41	pos	This G502 is quite similar in design and feel	
41	pos	I use it mostly for general computer use and only occasional gaming	
41	pos	Overall, I recommend this mouse	
41	pos	It is well built and feels like it will last a long time	
42	neg	The G Hub software is horrible	
42	neg	Eventually I was able to make everything work as I wanted but it was a frustrating day	
42	neg	But the G Hub software should be avoided if you can	
42	pos	I really like this mouse	
42	pos	I added all the included weights and it gives the mouse a very solid feel	
42	pos	It's comfortable and well designed	
42	pos	All I needed to do was adjust the DPI to my liking	
42	pos	Final comment, this mouse is great and I recommend it	
43	neg	If I game for 10+ hours it really starts to become an issue	
43	pos	This thing is built like a tank	
43	pos	It's heavy	
43	pos	It's solid	
43	pos	The RGB LEDs are fully programable	
43	pos	The cable feels pretty solid	
43	pos	It's accurate	
43	pos	The control of the mouse is great	
43	pos	Three clickers is the new norm	
43	pos	Getting used to it takes about two to three days, but when you do, its like wow, why didn't we normalize this sooner	
43	pos	Works great for everything	
43	pos	Again, works great	
43	pos	10/10This is far superiors to any other mmo mouse out IMO	
44	neg	Cons:DPI buttons are a little too close to the left mouse button	
44	neg	It's easy and fast to switch back, but can be annoying	
44	pos	It's a great mouse	
44	pos	Pros:Removable weights allow you to customize how hefty it is in hand	
44	pos	DPI settings are great	
44	pos	Really let's you set your sensitivity level and quickly make changes to it based on what you're doing	
44	pos	Customizable lighting	
44	pos	You will need to download the app, but you can change the lighting to what color you want and also how it lights up or reacts to sound	
44	pos	This mouse feels great in the hand	
44	pos	I have large hands and it still feels great to me	
44	pos	This has been an amazing mouse so far and I'm really enjoying it	
45	neg	Cons:Feels light/cheap even with the added weights, like every piece of plastic was as thin as they could make it without it shattering during shipping	
45	neg	It does it less when you turn off freewheel and use clicky wheel, but it's still audible there, too	
45	neg	Some settings don't seem to be editable in onboard memory, you have to download the profile, update it there, then re-upload it	
45	pos	Pros:Solid sensor, good programmable button options, software worked well on Windows 10 and Mac OSX	
45	pos	The rubber on the side grips feels good	
45	pos	Settings can be saved to onboard memory, so the color and speed and button tweaks work on any machine, not just ones with the driver and your profile installed, unlike Razor	
46	neg	I'm not sure if I have a defective product but the mouse wheel is off balanced	
46	neg	If you slowly move the mouse wheel up in increments (as if you're browsing a webpage), the wheel will slightly rock backwards	
46	neg	Looked up the issue online and apparently this is a common production flaw with the G502 series	
46	neg	Furthermore, having to use G Hub to program the mouse is an absolute nightmare of an experience, honestly I think I hated having to use that software than the issue with the mouse wheel	
46	neg	Save yourself the frustration, anger, and rage and download the Logitech Gaming Software 9	
47	neg	WARNING, This product to function correctly requires you to install literal spyware	
47	neg	Why does my mouse require a 100% Uptime Service running in the backround	
47	neg	Data collection pure and simple	
47	neg	-Other device and system activity including feature usage, performance metrics, errors, crash data, etc	
47	neg	Or the Stick Left clickmaybe the Left click that clicks, but does not do anything, then you have to really press it in and it registers, or tap your finger on a different spot	
49	neg	The programmable buttons on this mouse have weak action and are easy to press by accident	
49	neg	The cursor would start randomly moving	
49	neg	The mouse was sending a continual "right" or "up" or other signal to the computer	
49	neg	Sometimes I would have to disconnect/reconnect the USB to get it to work again	
49	pos	I use programmable mice to speed up programming tasks	
50	neg	About 6 months after purchasing, the mouse lost the ability to hold a left-click	
50	neg	In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down	
50	neg	This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible	
51	neg	The issue for mine occurred in the right button and involved double clicks/the button not recognizing being held	
51	neg	The same issue has just started to pop up for a friend as well with their system	
51	neg	Double clicks/phantom presses/non-consistent presses	
52	neg	First thing I noticed, the free spinning of the scroll wheel is completely useless	
52	neg	The issues really stem from button placement and a VERY horrible scroll wheel	
52	neg	I would not get this mouse again even though it's #1 in computer mice category at the time of this review	
52	pos	The movement seems fine so far	
53	neg	I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment	
53	neg	There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software	
53	neg	How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience	
53	neg	However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine	
53	neg	The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all	
53	neg	And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw	
53	neg	And finally, there is the rattling sound	
53	neg	It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying	
53	neg	But then I met the Logitech software problem	
53	neg	But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse	
53	neg	G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse	
53	neg	Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS	
53	pos	In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good	
53	pos	It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect	
53	pos	G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros	
54	neg	But at the same time the design is frankly, just weird	
54	pos	So, this mouse is really good for what it's supposed to do, which is be a mouse	
54	pos	It responds well, I haven't had any of the issues I normally do with other brands such as Corsair, like buttons not responding, registering 2 clicks when it was only one, the wheel giving out or just generally dying after a few months	
55	neg	This Logitech G502 Hero mouse is garbage	
55	neg	I have accidentally opened a few folders, only to have to use my keyboard to go back safely	
56	neg	The one huge giant issue I've already run into in my first week of owning it is the new version of the horrible "G HUB" software	
56	neg	It constantly ignores my profile and button assignments	
56	neg	I have the mouse set to use 400 dpi with all profile switching and DPI switching buttons disabled	
56	neg	At least once a day I need to un plug and re plug in my mouse as it seems to go to the default 1200 dpi, and ignores all my configured buttons	
56	pos	The mouse feels great, just like my 6 year old g502 that finally bit the bullet on me	
56	pos	Good weight, good cable, scrolling and buttons all feel good	
57	neg	The mechanical aspects of the wheel also are very poor, as the "free wheel" and the "resistance mode" of the mouse feel pretty much the same, resistance mode I can almost free spin the mouse to the same extent of free wheel	
57	neg	Added to the fact that it just feels clunky, loose, and wobbles around making a rattling sound when Im using it	
57	neg	I was feeling more like the mouse wheel was made for some $3 trash mouse you would buy in a swap meet and they just threw it in there	
57	neg	I dont know exactly what it was about the design, but from the first moment I used it, it just felt wrong in my hand	
58	neg	This model suffers from a design or manufacturing flaw	
58	neg	So you point and click, but the mouse moves the cursor a little, so you miss your target	
58	neg	I marked it down one star for the software and button arrangement, and down two more stars for the bottom plate defect	
58	pos	The weights are friction fit, so they stay in place	
59	neg	Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones	
59	neg	The BAD:This mouse doesn’t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place	
59	neg	Another issue is plastic	
59	neg	Cheap plastic everywhere that is	
59	neg	Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions	
59	neg	Summary:Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse	
59	pos	)The GOOD:The sensor is top notch	
59	pos	Cord is pretty nice	
59	pos	Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality	
59	pos	Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English	
60	neg	But, for me anyway, for my uses it has a major flaw: It's kind of small, so anyone who uses a Palm Mouse Grip will find it uncomfortable	
60	neg	That factor comes into play during long/er gaming sessions, because to a large degree it majorly reduces hand fatigue & maximizes comfort	
61	neg	I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed	
61	neg	You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward "palm pinch"	
61	neg	If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much	
61	neg	The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it	
61	neg	After only a year, this is appalling	
61	neg	If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare	
61	neg	If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony	
61	neg	This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half	
62	neg	Such a disappointment	
63	neg	ANY other grip is PAINFUL	
63	neg	I'm NOT SAYING it doesn't work WELL, just that it has extremely limited grip styles	
63	pos	This mouse is precision	
63	pos	Everything works precisely and is accurate	
63	pos	Nice to be able to change dpi on the fly	
63	pos	Where it shines:  Precision and smooothe sliders make it a snag free accurate mouse, clicky scroll wheelmouse cable never noticed while in use	
63	pos	I personally prefer for the mouse to support my other fingers	
63	pos	I am paying the mouse after all	
65	neg	I can't copy and paste text with this mouse at all	
65	neg	Tried multiple computers - same result	
65	neg	G502 is defective and you can see a lot of videos and read reports of these problems	
65	neg	It feels good in the hand, but impossible to use	
65	neg	Forget about gaming of any sort since it will not do what you tell it to do	
66	neg	The recent versions show a lack of quality in workman ship	
66	neg	Issues I've encountered:  1) double-click on single for both left and right, rarely at the same time	
66	neg	2) Mouse wheel gets stuck in a push (I barely use the mouse wheel as is, but seen it get stuck in the shift function)	
66	neg	3) Mouse wheel keeps spinning after touch (basically, the weight is off and keeps spinning until it corrects where it thinks it wants to be, not where user places wheel)	
66	neg	4) software updates requires a system reboot and locks all functionality until restarted	
66	neg	Mouse rated for 50M clicks (per Logitech's website), no way I've hit that in 4 months	
67	neg	Let’s start with the software: I installed it easily enough but it wouldn’t recognize the mouse	
67	neg	Except scrolling was inverted and it would go up when I tried scrolling down and viceversa	
67	neg	More wasted time, more restarts and more reinstalls and setups later and best I would get was a couple hours of work before shortcuts crapped out again	
67	pos	I need different shortcuts on different software and so the G502 works perfectly and the user interface (which has been updated, but I haven’t replaced there) is easy to use	
68	pos	Instead I received a great quality mouse that felt better in my hand and even shocked me with its great remapping software	
68	pos	The integrated games mapping is awesome	
68	pos	Before I had to go into a game and find the mapping to make a profile on my mouse and remap that to whatever button I wanted	
68	pos	With the Logitech software it scans the games and tells you exactly what mappings do what	
68	pos	It's kind of hard to explain but it makes things so much easier	
69	neg	probably because it's a terrible shape	
70	neg	My main issue with the mouse itself is that I find myself accidentally clicking the left mouse button pretty often with the G502, so I think buttons are quite a bit lighter/easier to press on this mouse	
70	neg	The thing that I really dislike the most about this mouse is  G Hub, the software Logitech pretty much forces you to use if you want to get the most out of the mouse	
70	neg	Overall, I'm pretty displeased with this mouse	
71	neg	My mouse's left click started double clicking on every click about two months into ownership	
71	pos	This is an absolutely fantastic right handed mouse	
71	pos	I literally can't find anything else that feels as good as this does on my hand and wrist	
72	neg	This mouse even with the weights added feels very light, much lighter than the G700s	
72	neg	It also feels incredibly cheap, especially the scroll wheel which feels very flimsy	
72	neg	The scroll wheel is also annoyingly loud when not in frictionless mode	
72	neg	It does not have a smooth clicking sound like the G700s, but sounds like its grinding	
72	neg	Frictionless mode is really loose scrolling up and down pages, far more than a G700s	
72	neg	Ergonomically its smaller than a G700s, sitting much lower and does not feel like any the older G-series mice, forcing me to uncomfortably extend my wrist	
73	neg	Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing	
73	neg	The mouse wheel buttons are defective	
73	neg	If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly)	
73	neg	The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch	
73	neg	They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button	
73	neg	You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously	
73	neg	I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well	
73	pos	Loved the mouse	
74	pos	It even worked when mostly broken	
74	pos	When it’s not broken it works fantastic as well	
74	pos	Accurate, super customizable, wonderfully ergonomic if you have giant weight lifting meat claws like me	
75	neg	This new mouse (logitech hero), developed the same issue in less then a couple months	
76	neg	The software is not intuitive, and seems to have a mind of its own	
76	pos	Logitech makes great stuff, I have many other items	
76	pos	This mouse is built well, solid and feels good	
76	pos	Just way too much overkill	
77	neg	When this mouse began showing the same symptoms, I was disheartened to say the least, especially so since the mouse was out of the return window, but less than a year old	
77	neg	The cause of the double-click bug is due to a technical oversight in the switches longevity when in a newer, more power-conservative circuit, I was told	
77	neg	If you can replace the switches, either by yourself or with some help, I can recommend this mouse, otherwise, expect to replace it within two years, most likely	
77	neg	I can think of at least ten different ways to prevent this pin from sliding	
77	neg	I've had good experiences with their products every single time I've bought them until now, and its very unfortunate that this is the first thing I've bought from them that has disappointed me	
77	neg	I cannot recommend this mouse	
78	neg	The only issue I have had, as have others, is the middle wheel/button	
78	neg	It is very easy to mis-click with it, and hit one of the side buttons when trying to click the center	
78	neg	I highly recommend not using the center or wheel side buttons for anything essential in the game, as in the heat of a big battle, the odds of you hitting the wrong ability are pretty high	
78	pos	It has performed quite well, and with my large hands, the fit is pretty good	
78	pos	The scroll function is good, and it's nice to be able to turn off the wheel clicker for free scrolling when I want	
78	pos	With adjustment capability and a better middle button/scroll, this would be a 6 star mouse	
78	pos	I don't regret buying and using this mouse	
79	neg	Turns out it did not last even 4 months before the left click started to double click and lose the sensor that is is being held down	
79	neg	I click and drag a lot for work, and this is unacceptable that the mouse did not even make it a year	
79	neg	Very disappointed in Logitech product quality for this price range	
80	pos	There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately	
80	pos	So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs	
80	pos	- Fits incredibly well around your hand	
80	pos	- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc	
80	pos	- Great grip	
80	pos	Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's	
80	pos	The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse	
80	pos	- The buttons are programmable	
80	pos	This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want	
80	pos	I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back	
80	pos	With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer	
80	pos	Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure	
80	pos	Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in	
81	neg	I have 2 complaints and that is that the 2 buttons to the side of the left-click button are easy to click on accident	
81	neg	It doesn't happen to me a lot, but it definitely does happen usually when I go to place my hand back on the mouse	
81	neg	My second complaint is that the rubber grips get dirty and it is kind of hard to clean in my opinion because of the texture it has	
81	pos	This mouse is awesome for gaming and office work	
81	pos	I have bigger hands and my hand fits comfortably	
81	pos	I do a ton of gaming with a side of office work with daily use and this mouse holds up for whatever task is thrown at it	
81	pos	The RGB is a nice touch	
81	pos	I like that when you change your DPI you can quickly glance at the RGB lights to determine which one you're using	
81	pos	Great mouse overall	
82	neg	Love this except for one flaw that is kinda bothering me	
82	neg	I’ve rearranged the weights several times to try to fix, to no avail	
82	neg	So this makes me wonder now if I DO in fact have a defective product	
82	pos	The mouse fits comfortably to my hand, feels great, and has great response times	
82	pos	Same design and after using it for a week, I’m completely in love	
83	neg	For some games, this may not even noticeable, but for others it can render the game unplayable	
83	neg	From what I've read online (could be completely wrong, I'm not an expert) the switches logitech uses are relatively cheap Chinese-made switches not ideal for operating at the low voltages this mouse outputs	
84	pos	I have larger hands and this mouse is a little longer than others I've tried so it fits me really well	
84	pos	I love the freewheel scroll feature	
84	pos	I don't think I will be able to go back to a mouse without that after using this thing	
84	pos	This mouse has just about everything I could ask for	
84	pos	Different profiles, on the fly sensitivity changes, plenty of buttons, customizable RGB	
84	pos	Its a fairly heavy mouse even without the weights	
84	pos	I have left the weights out completely of both of my mice	
84	pos	I would say it is fairly durable	
85	neg	Ergonomically, it feels bulky and a bit awkward	
85	neg	It still periodically freezes and requires a re-install to get it working again	
85	neg	More errors	
85	neg	Downgraded to 1 star because I am no longer using the mouse due to software issues	
85	pos	If the software's going to be integral it should be light, precise and stable	
85	pos	It is none of those things	
86	neg	You can't turn the RGB off but you can set it to one colour and not have it flashing	
87	neg	The one drawback I've found is the scroll wheel	
87	neg	However, when in freewheel, the wheel has a terrible tendency to have backlash, most likely due to the sensor design	
87	neg	I found the left-right scroll doesn't work with all programs either (Excel being one), which was also a disappointment	
87	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a very disappointing Corsair mouse of similar design that finally wore out	
88	neg	After only a single year, the primary button, m1, suffers from severe stuttering and unreliable response from user inputs	
88	neg	It is utterly ridiculous for a mouse at this price point to suffer from a hardware flaw like this so soon, and apparently it is a common issue with many other logitech brand mice	
89	neg	This mouse is a major disappointment	
89	neg	The biggest problem is a defective left-click button	
90	neg	Just holding this mouse makes my wrist cramp, it forces a claw-grip with your pinky and ring finger to hold the mouse and is extremely uncomfortable when you have to grip it hard	
90	neg	The Software (G Hub) is required, and has to be RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND at all times in order for 90% of the mouse's features to work	
90	neg	The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck	
91	neg	The issue was that the left click was no longer working as intended	
91	neg	I was not able to click and drag anything and would occasionally register a double click	
92	pos	This will give you the most precise tracking you can get from the mouse	
92	pos	I love heavier mice and this one has weights	
92	pos	Surely a Plus as well for me	
93	neg	but *EVERY* time it does an update to its software (which is at least once a week) it WIPES OUT all your settings	
93	neg	so you have to go back through and ONE BY ONE put each setting back on each button	
93	neg	it COMPLETELY ignores your settings to not update	
93	pos	this has the potential to be SUCH a great mouse	
94	neg	The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn’t applicable for everyone	
94	neg	Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake	
94	neg	The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them	
94	pos	The adjustable weights are also a plus	
94	pos	The extra buttons are also a big plus	
94	pos	It has a couple and they can be very useful	
95	pos	It feels very solid and slides effortlessly	
96	neg	Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great	
96	neg	The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached	
96	neg	The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far	
96	neg	That button is way to far forward	
96	neg	This thing feels really cheap	
96	neg	The buttons are super flimsy	
96	neg	If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in	
96	neg	Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed	
96	neg	Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars	
96	pos	The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time	
96	pos	Still braided, but way more flexible	
97	neg	The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed	
97	pos	First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well	
97	pos	I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons	
97	pos	Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it	
97	pos	As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable	
97	pos	All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it	
97	pos	If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far	
98	pos	This is a fantastic mouse	
98	pos	The buttons and even the scroll wheel are PERFECTLY clicky	
98	pos	If you don't like that, the scroll wheel "click" can be turned off with the button directly under it, so it free spins	
98	pos	and can built your own, along with setting up the "G" logo color palette	
98	pos	The sides are rubberized, which provides excellent control for button use	
98	pos	The bottom is slighlt gridded for friction & the wire is covered in woven nylon & runs about 6 ft	
98	pos	I couldn't be happier with this mouse	
99	pos	Way better/more customization option, buttons clicks really good and overall build quality is awesome despite the cost of this mouse just being 40$	
99	pos	Little plastic container contains multiple weights to weigh down your mouse is a surprise for me	
99	pos	Those thing fits under discretely	
99	pos	Placement sucks	
99	pos	Other than that issue, overall mouse is really good	
99	pos	Like, actually good	
100	neg	Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button	
100	neg	Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the "which folder did the file get dropped into	
100	pos	The resolution as expected	
101	neg	The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms	
101	pos	Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel	
101	pos	Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online	
101	pos	The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling	
101	pos	The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it	
101	pos	The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside	
102	pos	It fits nicely in the hand, has adjustable weights, and the perfect number of buttons for most gaming styles	
103	neg	Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65	
103	pos	The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool	
103	pos	The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using	
103	pos	With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth	
103	pos	I've always avoided Logitech products because of their "office" products, but this mouse has definitely exceeded my expectations so far	
104	neg	I am having tracking issues with mine	
104	neg	But when using it, you can feel it hang on something and stop moving for a sec	
104	neg	But this mouse not working for me	
105	neg	Two issues immediately stood out	
105	neg	The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode	
105	pos	The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky	
106	neg	Glider Wheel broke several months in	
106	neg	Again, the right click stopped working	
106	neg	It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react	
106	neg	I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing	
106	neg	Unreliable DPI stability feature	
106	neg	The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage	
106	neg	There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed	
106	pos	The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces	
106	pos	It is comfortable	
107	neg	G-Hub did not work on Win 7 for me, and there's no Linux support	
108	pos	It was comfortable to use so I never put much thought into it	
108	pos	And holy cow is this an awesome mouse	
108	pos	The customization features in the Logitech Software alone is super easy to use and make adjustments for later	
108	pos	Console gamers looking to dive into PC, give this mouse a shot, it has enough customization options to fit just about anyone’s needs	
110	neg	The only annoying thing about it is the non-adjustable "thunk" of the scroll wheel, it's too "notchy"	
110	neg	- if you engage it, the scroll wheel has a super annoying "thunk" every time you turn the mouse wheel	
110	pos	This is an extremely precise and reliable mouse, both with movement and scroll wheel	
111	neg	Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly	
111	pos	Buttons: It has enough buttons to assign several functions to them in games without going overboard	
111	pos	Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added	
111	pos	There is a hinged magnetic "door" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim	
111	pos	The jiggle was nearly eliminated and the friction free scrolling still works fine	
112	neg	Sadly, after using it for an afternoon, I found to be a poor choice for me	
112	neg	Cons:-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged	
112	neg	When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it	
112	neg	I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button	
112	neg	Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time	
112	neg	I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets	
112	pos	Pros:-The smoothness of the sensing is excellent	
112	pos	I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse	
112	pos	-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying	
112	pos	-Materials do seem to be nice and solid	
112	pos	-The weights are a nice touch for customizability	
112	pos	-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy	
112	pos	Colors are customizeable	
112	pos	-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself	
112	pos	-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large	
112	pos	Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape	
112	pos	-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice	
113	neg	The left click works when it wants too	
114	neg	It would randomly drag itself across the screen and freeze and I’d have to unplug and re-plug-in the mouse to my computer in order for it to start up again	
114	neg	Super annoying after the first two or three times and it began doing it more often as time went on	
114	neg	This one is not worth buying	
115	neg	NEGATIVES:What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons	
115	neg	MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare	
115	neg	The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states	
115	neg	* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness	
115	neg	You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will "back rock" or fore rock" to cradle itself between the teeth	
115	neg	Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor	
115	neg	I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed	
115	neg	But this wheel, I HATE IT	
115	neg	I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it	
115	neg	It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse	
115	neg	It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise	
115	pos	It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature	
115	pos	POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good	
116	neg	I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size	
116	neg	Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse	
116	pos	To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me	
116	pos	Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons	
117	neg	G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS	
117	pos	FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand	
117	pos	It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use	
118	neg	It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software	
118	neg	To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software	
119	neg	The one thing I don't like about the mouse that I've gotten used to is the size, my hand dwarfs this mouse	
119	neg	Took it apart and the right click switch metal piece had broke and won't work anymore	
119	pos	My favorite aspect of the mouse is the adjustable weight	
119	pos	i like my mouse to be heavier and i was pleasantly surprised that it came with quite a bit of weight i could add to it and make it the perfect weight	
119	pos	The RGB lighting customization for the mouse is great and the software is super easy to use and that's where you can set your custom DPI and use the button on the mouse to quickly switch between the settings	
119	pos	I would recommend this mouse to someone who is looking for a good FPS mouse that wont break the bank	
120	neg	I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire	
121	neg	Just so, so, so very loud	
122	pos	I like this mouse alot just wish they had an XL version	
123	neg	It's been getting worse and worse	
123	neg	I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable	
123	neg	However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had	
123	pos	The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602	
123	pos	The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap	
124	neg	tl;dr: I have big hands, the mouse is too tapered for my palm grip and is uncomfortable	
125	neg	CONS- Software is very glitchy and bloated	
125	neg	Takes up a lot of memory just to assign a few buttons	
125	neg	After two months of web-browsing use, the scrolling action no longer registers accurately	
125	neg	Clicking with the wheel works, but scrolling up and down has about a 20% success rate	
127	neg	It started having double clicking issues, and I ended up chucking it	
127	neg	NOW, we get to the major issue	
127	neg	I've tried cleaning it, adjusting my mouse double-clicking speed, but to no avail	
127	neg	I'm so tired of Logitech and how cheap their mice are built	
127	neg	It's a crying shame too because I think the mouse is great for gaming, but that stupid double click issue is not being resolved	
127	pos	What I love about the mouse is the number of buttons you have and how it feels	
127	pos	I like heavy mice and it comes with adjustable weights	
127	pos	I also like how I'm able to customize the mouse to how I play my games with the software	
127	pos	I feel it's just more user-friendly	
127	pos	I also like the "Free" mouse scrolling wheel	
127	pos	Overall the mouse looks and feels good, and the price was wallet-friendly	
128	neg	The free wheel, while quiet, is annoying as all heck - while a great idea, it just doesn't work practically when in a game or document	
128	neg	lol The mechanical resistance scroll is really loud and difficult to move	
128	neg	So you basically choose between an uncontrollable infinite scroll or a "stuck" mouse wheel	
128	neg	But it's so loud	
128	neg	So damn loud	
128	pos	It's fast, it's comfortable, and it looks nice	
128	pos	The design is high quality and very well made	
129	pos	The removable weights are very nice, too (I prefer all of them to be in)	
129	pos	It has a very satisfying click and the wheel can either be smooth or lightly clicky	
129	pos	You can also adjust your pointer speed directly on the mouse, which I adore	
129	pos	The cord is long and has a fabric covering	
129	pos	It also moves very smoothly on the mousepad and works great with super fast pointer speed	
130	pos	The shape and feel of the mouse is nice, and comfortable for people with larger hands	
131	pos	Sensor, settings and rbg are all perfect, G-Hub is a great program and lets you set different profiles for each game	
132	neg	Like the software that i needed to download, very unintuitive, i am in the process of having to open the app everytime i want to game	
133	pos	No complaints so far, I prefer all the weights in, as I have larger hands, and having more weight makes it smoother, I don't feel like I'm going to throw the mouse by accident	
133	pos	Cable seems to be high quality, With the adjustable DPS and colors, it's fairly customizable as well	
133	pos	Great mouse so far	
134	pos	This works great at a good price	
135	neg	sadly this was worse than the others, within 8 hours of gaming the scroll wheel jad lost it click stops and had shorted the side wheel switches	
135	neg	This mouse is a piece of junk	
137	neg	Cons: Too big for my hand, lack of control b/c of overall size	
137	pos	So, 40 bucks is a fair price point for this mouse - a separate software download from the internet makes it completely customizable to your liking	
137	pos	The weights that come with it are nice quality	
137	pos	Pros include weights you can add/subtract, DPI options, and LED lights with option to sync with other Logitech products	
138	neg	Honestly disappointing	
138	pos	Best part of the mouse was the mouse wheel which I had a lot of fun just spinning	
139	neg	Do NOT use it for in game macros	
139	pos	The keyboard I bought is also a Logitech, and the G Hub software that goes with these devices is excellent	
139	pos	Gold Standard	
140	neg	The scroll wheel on the Hero is not only wobbly, but the tactile actuation force difference between left tilt and right tilt is significant	
140	neg	Right tilt too easy to trigger	
140	neg	Wheel scrolling in notched mode is very loud, as loud as my Kaihl brown keyboard switches	
141	neg	- Buttons feel kind of cheap	
142	pos	I love it and it was on sale for maybe $50 or so, to be honest I don't remember the price because it was low	
143	pos	It has the exact same feel as the Proteus	
144	neg	Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death	
145	neg	Going on 45 days now, 14 emails, a tracking number where nothing has shipped and multiple attempts to resolve a warranty claim, as usual, Logitech simply ignores you as user once they run of excuses in their agent script-book	
145	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again	
146	neg	I bought this on sale and I'll buy Logitech over the flashy garbage that Razer puts out for gamers any day	
146	neg	I decided to move on from the Corsair mouse I liked after I went through two in 4 years	
146	neg	When a mouse is ~$100 it shouldn't break from moderate use	
146	neg	I was looking for something that felt nice and I could stand it breaking in the next two years	
146	neg	My only other issue is I keep accidentally pushing the DPI shift button at the tip of my thumb consistently	
146	neg	I can get used to it and adjust, but it's enough to prevent a full five stars	
146	pos	The weight adjustment is a nice feature, and the handful of programmable buttons is great	
146	pos	I use various macros or prefer to have some oft-used keys on in reach of my thumb quite a bit	
146	pos	The G Hub software is easy to use, so getting all set up the way I wanted took less than 20 minutes	
146	pos	After I read another review after thinking the scroll wheel just sucked, I was very satisfied	
146	pos	I initially thought there was no tactile feedback to the wheel, but there was a button for it	
146	pos	It must have come in one position, or I accidentally hit it, but once I clicked it everything felt great	
147	neg	The first thing that I thought when I first used the mouse is it's narrow profile, which is much too narrow for the average man's hands, leaving your pinky and ring finger dragging on the desk or struggling to find room to grip the mouse	
147	neg	The RGB LEDs are not all that impressive because only two parts of the mouse light up	
147	neg	) Another quirk: this mouse is strongly magnetic at the bottom which causes it to stick somewhat to my stainless steel desk	
148	neg	UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a "reliable" solution to yet	
148	neg	DO NOT PURCHASE THISUnless you're willing to adapt to its faults	
148	pos	It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit	
148	pos	For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off	
149	neg	The media could not be loaded	
149	neg	I needed a replacement for my old G402, the left button switch was randomly double clicking on single press	
149	neg	One thing I'm a little apprehensive about is the scroll wheel	
149	neg	It rattles around and seems to shake the entire mouse when scrolling in regular mode, not hyperfast mode (free spin)	
149	neg	I'll update if it gets worse	
149	pos	So far the 502 is living up to the high logitech standards I'm used to	
149	pos	Just like the 402, the 502 Hero is good for people with larger hands	
149	pos	The buttons schemes are almost identical which made the transition to the 502 seamless	
149	pos	The shape of the mouse is comfortable and easy to get used to	
149	pos	The feet seem good it glides across my mousepad with ease	
149	pos	There is slightly more friction than my old 402, but that may just be because it's not broken in yet	
149	pos	All in all it seems like a good buy, but if you get it on sale then it's almost a MUST buy	
149	pos	There are enough features for the hard core gamer and it's easy and comfortable enough to use for the average gamer	
150	neg	Be aware that the double click issue may not be the hardware, other words the internal micro switch	
151	neg	The mode wheel is a little too stiff for my liking, it really ka-chunk ka-chunks into the detents	
151	pos	I wasn’t sure if I’d like the DPI shift button or not, and figured I’d just re-bind it to another function, but I actually like it	
151	pos	I wish this had one more thumb button, as I tend to bind this to the “inventory” of the games I play	
151	pos	The cable is super flexible, so it doesn’t “spring” the mouse when you let go of it, like my old mouse occasionally did	
151	pos	The mouse has a decent weight to it without using the supplied weights, but that’s personal preference	
151	pos	I have rather large hands and it fits nice in my hand	
151	pos	All of the buttons are reachable for me	
152	neg	Turns out the onboard memory cannot be programmed for macros or most other useful functions	
152	neg	These functions are only available if you have G Hub open at ALL TIMES, which is very annoying	
152	neg	This means if you do not have G Hub installed on any of the devices you plan on using this with, it will only do the basic functions of a mouse	
152	neg	I tried calling support only to find myself talking to someone who barely spoke English, and he couldn’t give me a good answer on why I can’t program a macro onto my mouse	
152	neg	Unless Logitech is able to fix this with an update, I would not recommend this mouse to anyone	
152	pos	Bought this mouse in hopes to use it and program it for gaming	
153	neg	Low quality materials	
153	neg	The wheel barely lasted a month and is now a weighted fly wheel	
153	neg	So you end up just unintentionally increasing the DPI setting to ridiculously high settings forcing you to somehow open the utility to fix it	
153	neg	Yeah, the software sucks too	
153	pos	The only thing decent about this is the magnetic bottom	
154	neg	Problem is the main right button was very finicky	
154	neg	I need to right click and hold the button for my games to aim and it the mouse would act like I wasn't holding the button down	
154	neg	I'd click and hold and it would act like I just clicked sometimes id have to click and hold 2,3,4,5 times before it would work right and let me aim	
154	neg	But it started doing it again a few weeks later and while trying to fix it myself again it finally broke	
154	neg	Definitely not happy with it and even less pleased with logitechs lack of customer service	
154	neg	Definitely won't be buying any more of their products	
154	pos	This mouse is super comfortable and fit my hand very well	
154	pos	The only fix I could find was to pull the button up gently and then press it back down hard and that fixed it for a while	
155	neg	The g502 does not meet my expectations in for a daily use nor gaming mouse	
155	neg	I have small hands, and this mouse is actually too small for my palm that i'm actually squeezing my fingers to grip the mouse--this will be an even bigger issue for larger hands	
155	neg	Secondly, they sacrificed comfort and ergonomics and tried to make it look futuristic and stylish	
155	neg	They put an a steeper incline at the index finger, which is not the correct shape for your hands	
155	neg	Also the scroll wheel on free mode is unusable, and on click mode is very clunky and inaccurate	
155	neg	It's a very cheap and inaccurate wheel to control, and their gaming software gives no options to change this	
155	pos	I've purchased Logitech products since the 90s and have been an avid game, and they are always known for having top quality egonomics	
156	neg	Update: My prior Chinese manufactured G502 Hero died on me after I dropped it a few too many times	
156	neg	After owning this mouse for a total of two months, it is no longer fantastic	
156	neg	The mouse died on me without explanation	
156	neg	There is no conceivable reason for it having done so	
156	neg	It just suddenly connected and disconnected to my PC randomly before refusing to connect or power on ever again	
156	neg	This one does not work anymore	
156	neg	And, unfortunately, it died before I could return it	
156	neg	The lights on the mouse were erratic and not working properly	
156	neg	The mouse connected for a few minutes but the laser tracker was not functioning on the bottom of the mouse	
156	neg	The problem was with the G502 Hero mouse that suddenly died after I unplugged it the first time to try another port	
156	neg	It never turned on again and remained disconnected	
156	neg	Something short-circuited inside the mouse; it is a hardware issue	
156	pos	Other than the failure of the prior G502 Mouse I had purchased, this mouse is the best I have used to this date	
156	pos	I hope it doesn't spontaneously burn out after the warranty period ends	
156	pos	This mouse was fantastic	
157	neg	The bad: the mouse buttons take almost no effort to click - maybe half the effort compared to G602, so I end up clicking both buttons instead of one pretty often	
157	neg	Also, although I like being able to switch between the clicky and smooth motion of the wheel, the clicky mode is too loud, much louder than G602	
157	neg	Bottom line, I am returning this one and will look for something that fits my needs better	
157	pos	The good: the mouse fits my hand quite well, and it glides very nicely	
158	pos	It is fantastik	
158	pos	It is very responsive	
158	pos	I love the left thumb button on the G502 which the G700 did not have	
158	pos	It is a great mouse	
159	neg	Missing a foot, right button barely registers the click	
159	pos	It's a little smaller than the old one, but fits my hand better, even though I have big hands	
159	pos	I love the feel of the body, Very smooth	
159	pos	The response of the mouse is fantastic, but I still am learning what setting to use	
159	pos	Also getting use to the wheel, definitely a different feel from the old one	
159	pos	Over-all I believe this was a good buy - I actually got this here at a really good discount	
159	pos	I recommend this for the casual gamer - I have to try it with a FPS soon	
160	neg	The replacement mouse has four pads/feet on the bottom, whereas the initial mouse only has three—it’s missing the thin pad right below the G502 Hero logo	
160	neg	But here’s the kicker: the pad on the replacement mouse was misaligned and sticking up at its smallest point	
160	neg	The G502 Hero is a great mouse design, but unfortunately I’m not convinced it’ll last very long	
161	neg	I have been through 3 of these G502 mice in the last year and a half	
161	neg	All of them suffer from defective clickers	
161	neg	The left and right mouse buttons will often extra click, when you only want to click once	
161	neg	This is such a common problem for G502's that it has turned into a JOKE	
161	neg	Logitech should be ashamed of their disgusting product reliability	
161	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again, I am moving over to Corsair for everything	
161	neg	Stay away from Logitech products, you have been warned	
162	neg	At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events	
162	neg	If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning	
162	pos	I initially liked the mouse	
163	neg	It's extremely cheap plastic, I feel like this thing is going to break in my hands, I found myself treating it like a priceless artifact	
163	neg	The buttons move around and feel and sound so cheap, just that typical cheap plastic sound you get from toys at the Dollar Store	
163	neg	The weights don't fit well inside the mouse, I picked up the mouse to move it and the cheap bottom feel out as well as two weights	
163	neg	I'd had enough of this mouse after a night's worth of gaming when the adhesive at the top used to promote frictionless movement started to peel off and scratch my mouse pad	
163	neg	I'm speechless, I'm not sure how this could be one of the most sold gaming mice on the market	
164	neg	It was fantastic while it worked, but I have to dock two stars for not even lasting 2 years	
165	neg	Right mouse button randomly sticks or feels like a "short throw" and doesn't fully engage	
165	neg	It's damn frustrating for a mouse that costs this much	
165	neg	The "shift" button doesn't get much use, it's rather awkward and nearly pointless	
165	neg	Logitech, you've lost another loyal, disappointed customer	
166	neg	Weight is almost too much, even without the (seemingly) unnecessary extra weights (included) that you can install	
166	neg	Misses:  The mouse wheel	
166	neg	It has no other texture, isn't rubberized or textured in a way that helps prevent slippage	
166	neg	Couple that with the clunky 'speed bump' mechanism and it makes accurately scrolling the wheel difficult at best	
166	neg	Definitely not a high performance feature, and honestly it doesn't work particularly well for normal use	
166	neg	I'd love to love this, especially at the price point, but the wheel is such a constant issue that I'm not certain if it's something I can get past	
166	pos	Day 1 review, so just my initial impressions	
166	pos	Pluses: Build quality, weight, button feel are all on point	
166	pos	Tracking seems accurate	
166	pos	The 'thumb rest' (for right handed people anyway) is weird, though I think with more use it will be fine, maybe even a nice plus	
166	pos	It feels too smooth	
167	neg	mine broke after 3 years but i can see why people put up with it	
167	pos	good mouse and has what most people need	
168	neg	The scroll wheel feels way too loose, regardless of whether the clicker is on or off	
168	pos	I have to say, it's one of the most ergonomic peripherals I've used, very comfortable	
168	pos	The DPI on the fly button is something I'm used to and consider necessary	
168	pos	It's pretty good	
168	pos	Left and right click are standard, not to tight, not too loose	
168	pos	For the price, it's a great mouse and feels really solid	
169	neg	I wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but there's something about the angle your hand rests that makes certain actions a little awkward, at least for big hands	
169	neg	Another problem I have is that the DPI adjustment buttons are constantly being pressed by accident, one way or the other	
169	neg	After owning the mouse for about six months, the notorious g502 left-click issues began	
169	neg	It was spotty for a little while, but now it can't hold a click at all, making it essentially unusable	
169	pos	I bought this mouse because a few reviews indicated it was both a quality product and comfortable for people with big hands	
170	neg	The scroll wheel is hot garbage	
170	neg	First issues is that it's SUPER hard to scroll with it, scrolling takes a lot more finger strength than on a regular mouse and that's bad enough, you can turn off the click scrolling for smooth but then you have the problem that it's way too lose	
170	neg	The biggest issue I have with it is how insanely sensitive the mouse is when it comes to left and right click on the wheel button	
170	pos	It's a great mouse, it kills me that the scroll wheel sucks so much	
170	pos	It's accurate, the weights system is great, the clicking feels awesome, it has a lot of customizable buttons, all in all it's pretty awesome	
170	pos	It's made of metal, which everyone here seems to love, great, I don't have a problem with that part	
171	neg	ConsRGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand	
171	pos	This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features	
171	pos	The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed	
171	pos	Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse	
171	pos	With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better	
171	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant	
171	pos	The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well	
171	pos	The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons	
171	pos	The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate	
171	pos	This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse	
172	neg	Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button	
173	neg	Myonly complaint would be for the DPI	
173	pos	Overall I'm happy with this mouse	
173	pos	It connected easily enough and has a good amount of configurations available with the Logitech software	
173	pos	Weights are easy enough to add with a magnetic closure plate to make it sleek	
174	neg	6 months, that's when it appears, the double-clicking	
174	neg	And it doesn't seem that I'm the one who keeps getting issues, it's a flaw in the construction	
174	neg	It's especially frustrating when trying to work and be productive because the double click causes a lot of issues with editing work or creating assignments	
174	neg	And when you're gaming, you're at a major disadvantage because it double clicks more in games than in general use	
174	pos	This mouse was great the soon I got it	
174	pos	3 or 4 months pass, no issue	
176	neg	However, a few weeks ago the left mouse button started double clicking	
176	neg	I tried it with different computers and reset the settings on the mouse but nothing fixed it	
176	neg	It seems the switch is dying	
176	neg	My only complaint in all of this is the software	
176	neg	I had to recreate my profiles manually, which was a pain, but not enough to detract a star	
176	pos	I bought a G502 years ago, when the line first launched, and I loved it	
176	pos	I used it for hours each day for those years, and I never regretted that purchase	
176	pos	It is every bit as good as the original	
177	neg	My main issue with this mouse is how easy it is to accidentally bump the dpi change buttons while gaming	
177	neg	Also the tactile feel of the side thumb buttons is not as good as my older G700s	
177	neg	I will seek out a better alternative as the inadvertent dpi switching is becoming an issue while gaming	
177	pos	Mouse seems to track well and the g hub software is adequate	
177	pos	The forward and back buttons are smooth and the feel between them is almost indistinguishable	
178	neg	No brain buy here	
178	pos	This mouse is way more than satisfactory for my preferences, and I am picky about weight, adjustable weights, feet that glide smoothly, supportive software, customization, lighting, scroll wheel functionality, ergonomics, and of course braided cable	
179	neg	This thing has been an absolute nightmare since I’ve bought it	
179	neg	Holding down the left mouse button and performing things like simple click and drag functions, were close to impossible as the mouse would without warning unclick or register the holding of the mouse as a double click	
180	neg	I'm not the only one with this problem it seems, but the switches in this mouse don't hold up to even light gaming	
180	neg	I've had it for 3 months minus a day, and already I have lost the ability to click and drag *at all*	
180	neg	Overall the left click died far too fast	
180	pos	Great ergonomics, great sensor	
181	neg	____________________CONS_____________________weight:This mouse is too heavy for actual competitive gaming	
181	neg	However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly	
181	neg	If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray	
181	neg	Point is, the g502 hero is one of the worse mice you can get from logitech	
181	pos	This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk	
181	pos	I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great	
181	pos	_____________________PROS_____________________extremely customizable:Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun	
181	pos	visually satisfying:it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool	
181	pos	cool scroll button:you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel	
181	pos	Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly	
183	neg	When you are scrolling through things it tends to "jump" really far ahead or really far back and it is incredibly annoying	
184	pos	I can easily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice gaming or regular mouse with additional comfort	
185	neg	The Cons:LG Hub software is garbage	
185	neg	It installed but would not run on my Win 10 x64 PC	
185	neg	I have tried re-installing several times without any success	
185	neg	Instructions for the mouse are also quite poor	
185	neg	The updated Logitech software is trash though	
185	pos	The Pros:The mouse itself is well built	
185	pos	I love the dual mode scroll wheel as well	
186	neg	Update: After about 6 months, this mouse has broken in some way that makes it unusable	
186	neg	The sensor no longer tracks accurately and something as simple as clicking a link on a web page is nearly impossible due to the random movement it's adding to my motion	
187	neg	Within a month my left mouse button developed issues that resulted in clicking when there is no input, clicks not registering when there is input, and double clicking when releasing the button	
187	neg	My replacement mouse is already displaying the same symptoms of the first mouse	
187	neg	Less than a month in and I get phantom clicks and unintended double clicks	
187	neg	If you're looking to buy this for gaming, I recommend you look elsewhere	
188	neg	I'm a huge Logitech fan but this one is a failure, pretty much anything with the name HERO from them is a ZERO	
189	neg	The G502 is more on the heavy side for a mouse and I don't see a need to use any of the included weights	
189	neg	The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around	
189	neg	Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard	
189	pos	This mouse has a solid build quality and is comfortable for any grip style	
189	pos	Gaming and general usage so far have been great	
189	pos	The sensor seems to work on just about any normal desk surface	
190	pos	This is the best gaming mouse I have ever owned	
190	pos	I love the software, buttons, and all the cool stuff you can do	
190	pos	The top feature for me in particular is the scroll wheel, which with the press of a button lets you scroll freely instead of having it click in steps	
190	pos	I can't go to any other mouse now since to my knowledge none have that feature, and makes me wonder why other brands haven't universally adopted the feature	
191	neg	1 star off for the DPI buttons being to easy to click in between the left click and the back click	
191	neg	So all of a sudden having your mouse speed up or slow down means you need to train yourself as to how you position your fingers	
191	pos	A fully programmable mouse with plenty of easy to reach buttons and a fun lighting scheme	
191	pos	The embedded software is easy to use and low maintenance	
191	pos	The mouse feels great and has simple weights that can be added to increase the heft	
191	pos	Lots of buttons that can be programmed for intuitive use	
191	pos	Beyond that minor qualm, it's a great gaming mouse	
192	neg	i have owned 3 g502 heros in the span of around 8 months with each one having the ending up with the same problem, the right click will begin to freak out; registering several clicks with a single press/hold	
192	neg	this makes aiming down sights in games impossible and has remained a consistent issue through out all 3 of the g502 heros I've owned	
192	neg	the first one started showing issues 4 months after i bought it	
192	neg	same problem, Spazzy right click	
192	neg	Spazzy right click	
192	neg	honestly i don't really care to buy another mouse, or any product from Logitech going forward	
192	neg	it's a shame too, because this used to be a really good mouse	
193	neg	Only issues for me is this mouse is bigger than I expected (doesn't work for my wife, who has smaller hands) and I don't like the placement of the buttons by the thumb	
193	pos	I own a lot of 'gaming' mice and this is the best of the bunch, worth every penny	
193	pos	Other than that this mouse is outstanding	
193	pos	Buttery smooth mouse movements	
193	pos	I love the programmability of all the buttons, I love the apps, you can adjust settings to a fine level of detail	
193	pos	The craftmanship/feel is top-notch	
193	pos	There is a huge difference between this mouse and other cheaper gaming mice, definitely worth the price if it's in your budget	
194	pos	* The cord is well thought out	
194	pos	* Smooth as butter	
194	pos	* Not just great for gaming, but also great for photo editing	
194	pos	I'm always doing very tiny meticulous details & no other mouse has been good for that except this one	
195	neg	But the LED for the logo which you can change doesn't show pure white color	
195	neg	It has blue tone of color added to the white color and comes out in this weird color	
195	neg	No patterns or anything	
195	neg	There's no pattern to choose even if you set it to one color	
195	pos	The mouse itself is okay	
196	neg	Don't pay over that	
196	pos	However, I do love what I have customized with the settings for my regular day-to-day uses	
196	pos	I like that I can add weights to the mouse	
196	pos	The mouse is very responsive when I click around	
196	pos	I did discover with this mouse the delight of having a scroll wheel that you can change how it scrolls	
196	pos	Overall, an excellent mouse worth the price point of $40	
196	pos	Also, the pleasure of making the DPI setting faster than what the computer's DPI setting is maxed out at is great	
197	neg	This is a garbage product, especially since its marketed to the FPS market	
197	neg	This mouse has been a waste of time, money, and energy	
197	neg	This is a garbage product	
197	neg	I bought this mouse on March 29 of 2019, and its already having a lot of problems	
197	neg	Sensor and most of the buttons work fine, but the left mouse button is not working properly	
197	neg	It will either register a click, double click, no click, or 'unclick' when holding the button down	
197	neg	Its sorely disappointing after only having it for a year	
197	neg	Lots of people on tech forums are exacting the same frustrations	
197	neg	Its an endemic issue for this particular model	
198	pos	This mouse has on-board memory, which let's you save your configuration into it	
198	pos	This is nice, since I don't want to always run the Logitech software, and it's good for when you use this mouse on another computer and don't have the software there	
198	pos	With this mouse, it's so easy to change DPI with the DPI buttons	
198	pos	It's a plus that it has on-board memory	
198	pos	The side buttons are very tactile and feel really solid	
198	pos	Also, the left and right mouse click buttons have very low travel time and feel very responsive	
198	pos	I highly recommend this mouse for anyone that has big hands	
199	neg	The build quality felt cheap especially when it came to the rattling of the mouse wheel	
199	neg	Well since I procrastinated i had to use the g502 for the month and at the end of that month the left click feature started to double left click aprox	
199	neg	To sum it up, the mouse is ugly, cheap, looks like it was made for a child gamer to beg his parents to buy for them bc it looks futuristic and has a high DPI	
199	neg	BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, the left click feature started failing after a little over 2 months of use	
200	neg	Even if you adjust your sensitivity or add some of the weights the mouse comes with it is still really sensitive	
200	neg	For the price, I would not buy it again	
201	neg	This mouse cannot save macros onto the onboard memory	
201	neg	There is one issue that is common for the mouse, and that is the dreaded double-click issue that occurs with the G502	
201	neg	The switches for the buttons may begin to register two presses	
201	pos	The Logitech G502 in my opinion, is one of the best mice on the market you would ever get	
201	pos	Every button on the mouse is programmable, but there are 5 extras that you can use for DPI or macros	
201	pos	The ergonomics of the mouse are really good	
201	pos	I can keep a really good grip on the mouse, and its textured rubber on the sides help with gripping	
201	pos	I have quite large hands, and it still works flawlessly for me	
201	pos	The mouse has on-board memory in case of no internet or if you need to play somewhere other than your house	
201	pos	It only saves your RGB profiles and your sensitivity/DPI profiles	
201	pos	The weight actually comes in advantage for me, as the weight of the mouse balances the speed at which I move it	
201	pos	Overall this mouse is a godsend, and is what made me use Logitech for all of my peripherals	
202	neg	The only issue i have is a bit with the build quality its mostly plastic which is fine it has a decent feel for durability for a few months for me personally the side rubber grips get worn out so i end up buying a replacement	
202	pos	The Logitech Gaming Software is also amazing, no issues	
202	pos	But other than that i highly recommend it	
203	neg	This product has a massive design flaw	
203	neg	Logitech choose to go with cheap Chinese switches for this mouse and in a short period of time the switches are going to break	
203	neg	This causes the LMB and RMB double-click for no reason, a lot of times while still holding the button down	
204	pos	This is a great mouse	
204	pos	I bought it for gaming, and it is ergonomic and the click of the mouse is just right, not too loud	
204	pos	You can quickly interchange between DPI speed with a certain button, so it’s very convenient	
204	pos	It has lots of buttons that make navigating your computer a breeze	
204	pos	It also comes with some weights that you can put within the mouse to make it heavier or lighter based on what you like	
204	pos	This mouse works for drag clicking and the scroll button can click sideways and downward, as well as two scrolling settings, you can make it scroll very fast and smoothly or have normal scrolling	
204	pos	Definitely a great buy	
205	pos	I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to program keys to the mouse via their software which didn't take very long to download	
205	pos	You could also close the program and open from your desktop in seconds	
205	pos	I haven't had any mechanical issues	
205	pos	All the buttons work well (no double clicking)	
205	pos	I love the feature of the mouse wheel where if you push the button in below the wheel, it either opens fully or restricts slightly the motion of the wheel	
205	pos	It's really cool	
205	pos	I noticed that compared to any standard mouse I've ever used, my precision and accuracy of mouse movements has been greatly increased when using this mouse	
205	pos	I haven't messed around with the weights, but you can add/remove weights to make the mouse heavier/lighter	
205	pos	It's everything else about the mouse that I like	
205	pos	Overall, It's a great mouse	
206	neg	It's extremely frustrating to say the least	
206	neg	Except the setting is from a much older version so can't do that either	
206	neg	It's been 2 weeks and I already hate this thing	
206	neg	Trying to do anything when your mouse flicks across the screen because you're trying to use it, is beyond annoying	
207	neg	But somewhere in the added complexity of including stuff like that reduces the shelf life	
207	pos	_-------_The moose was great while it worked, it pairs well with Logitech keyboards and the color is consistent because why not have LEDs everywhere	
208	neg	Right mouse button started to fail after about a year	
208	neg	I mostly use it for computer graphics work so it was incredibly frustrating when the mouse would basically unclick in the middle of a drag and drop or resizing of a window	
208	neg	I was able to remap right click to another button, but for what I paid for it this is incredibly annoying	
209	neg	First one was great till it had a double click issue, I assumed it was just me being unlucky and got a second one because it felt great	
209	neg	And 1 year into it's life span it gets the double click issue again	
209	neg	Updating drivers doesn't work	
209	neg	Just poor quality in whatever they put into the clicker	
209	neg	Clarification on the double click issue, pressing the right side for me will double click every time you press it	
209	neg	Sometimes sticking so you cannot drag any windows anymore	
210	neg	CONS:Mistakenly hitting the sniper button	
210	neg	UPDATE 4/30/19: Had it for a few months i think but now it's causing an issue	
210	neg	Random double clicks when i try to hold down and drag something on my screen, noticed it when i was playing a game, caused my character to drop it on the ground instead of move it	
210	neg	Seems this is a big issue going on with ANY G502 models	
210	pos	I would recommend this product	
211	neg	First, the box was damaged a bit (As shown in picture) but that's okay, when I opened it up the mouse was dusty and dirty, it clearly had been used and refurbished (The box was sealed)	
211	neg	There were smudges and scratches beneath the mouse	
211	neg	The mouse looks sick and all, but it's actually not comfortable at all	
211	neg	After using it for an hour, the feeling of discomfort is ON	
211	neg	The scroll wheel is so stiff	
211	neg	Overall I'm not happy with this mouse for its price, I have better choices for even cheaper prices	
212	pos	The mouse feels great in the hand and all of the programable buttons are easy to reach	
212	pos	It also has additional weights to get your desired amount of drag resistance	
212	pos	The build quality seems pretty good	
212	pos	The scroll wheel is solid, the cable is braided, and the buttons all have a good feel to them	
212	pos	The Logitech software is very good for setting up macros, mapping buttons, changing RGB settings, etc	
212	pos	Overall it seems like a great mouse for the price	
213	neg	Minor issues to keep in mind, it has a lot of open edges/corners that can collect dust and dead skin cells	
213	pos	Plus, it's an excellent workout for your hand and arm movement	
213	pos	And it's comfortable too when holding it	
213	pos	The mouse response is good, plus the side buttons are an excellent feature	
213	pos	Steep price aside, I'd say it's a near-perfect mouse for your gaming and content creation needs	
214	neg	I took a chance on this mouse and yep, the hardware broke in short order	
214	neg	This mouse has just been on my desk with light use and already has issues	
215	neg	It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable	
216	neg	Unfortunately the Special Edition started having sustained click & drag problems, making it difficult drag & drop or highlight items after around a year of use	
216	pos	Both of my standard G502s have worked perfectly for me	
216	pos	The ergonomics are great, the button features are pleasant without being over riddled	
218	pos	That will be well used in World of Warcraft and Grounded the Game	
218	pos	This manufacturer has a very good rep especially with me	
218	pos	Rubber with bumpy grips on left and right, helps hold the hand in place	
218	pos	The cord is fabric lined so it doesn't have a "memory" of staying in a position it shouldn't	
219	pos	This particular model has been one of my favorites and I use it on my main gaming desktop as well as my work laptop	
219	pos	It has enough buttons to make it flexible without having so many as to make it overly complicated, especially for fingers that are not in the small glove category	
220	neg	Because they are literally right next to the left mouse button, it is super easy to accidentally press on it	
220	pos	The mouse itself is great, from a hardware standpoint	
220	pos	Fastest sensor, max of 25k dpi, reliable switches, what's not to like	
220	pos	There are 2 buttons right next to the left mouse button, the most used button on a mouse, the 2 buttons adjust the dpi (sensitivity) of the mouse	
221	neg	At that point - almost as if there was a timer in it, the left mouse button becomes intermittent	
221	neg	You are at an extreme disadvantage when the trigger fails 50% of the time - until a few days later it is completely gone	
221	pos	First of all, this is a really comfortable mouse to use	
221	pos	But it is so comfortable	
222	neg	Holding the RMB down will intermittently register multiple clicks	
223	neg	What drives me insane is how awful the "GHub" software is	
223	neg	It periodically updates and then randomly my mouse stops working until I spend 10-15 minutes fighting with the software to not default to a different profile or update firmware for a feature I don't need	u
223	pos	I absolutely love this mouse as a device	
223	pos	The buttons are great, it feels good in the hand, it's very responsive	
224	pos	I love this mouse	
224	pos	My girlfriend, who is a recent PC gamer convert, loves this mouse	
224	pos	This mouse feels comfortable	
224	pos	The customizable weights is a great idea	
224	pos	The customizable buttons are also great, too	
225	neg	Bought this a little over a year ago, started having issues with my left click button clicking multiple times with one click- very annoying and makes it impossible to use	
225	neg	Basically, Logitech uses cheap & poorly designed switches that wear out easily	
226	neg	Scroll wheel tilt functions are a little more mushy, and it's hard to tell when they're activated	
226	neg	The triangle patterns on both side of the mouse pick up dirt	
226	pos	Most of them have great response time, click well, and aren't mushy at all	
226	pos	DPI can be adjusted on-the-fly or if you're like me, those buttons can be used for other purposes like macros, in-game actions, etc	
226	pos	The good: 9 high-quality programmable buttons, and the scroll wheel	
226	pos	The scroll wheel can be toggled from having a "bumpy" mode to free-spinning using a mechanical button (can't be programmed cause it functions mechanically)	
226	pos	Weight can be changed	
226	pos	DPI display (3 bars of light) allow easy checking of DPI	
226	pos	Mouse can be tuned any way you want	
226	pos	Pretty good mouse	
227	neg	After a couple of months of use, this mouse wouldn't function properly, the pointer is jittery and won't hold among other things	
227	neg	The 2nd mouse is doing the same malfunctions as the first	
228	neg	You can have this problem with either the left or right buttons, or both	
228	neg	But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse	
228	neg	More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100	
229	pos	I have slightly large hands, and even though this mouse has a slightly smaller footprint than the g602 it still fits my hand better	
229	pos	I mean it REALLY feels great in my hand	
229	pos	Well worth the $80	
229	pos	I also love the logitech gaming software and the ability to adjust your DPI profile settings and such	
231	neg	The two buttons on the left side are a little too low	
231	neg	My biggest complaint is the scroll wheel is free flowing	
231	neg	It spins too easily and there's no click sensation	
231	pos	This mouse feels great	
232	neg	It requires different software (G Hub) which also requires uninstalling LGS	
233	neg	And this mouse failed me 5 days ago	
233	neg	it will drop the signal suddenly	
233	neg	Failed within half year is a totally new experience for me	
233	neg	However, it failed to deliver the basic mouse function	
233	pos	Beside this problem, it is a comfortable mouse	
234	neg	The left click on this startes getting flaky about 6months after purchase	
234	neg	It would randomly drop the click, so click-and-holds were frustrating	
234	neg	A full force press causes the drop, while a minimal force seems to work fine	
236	neg	Cons:- You are required to download the software for this mouse manually and it isn't the easiest interface I have ever used	
236	neg	Without previous software experience (mine being from razer synapse), it might be a challenge for inexperienced users	
236	pos	Pros:- Easy to map new bindings to each button with the software available	
236	pos	- Good solid feel to the mouse overall and about the same size as the razer 2013 deathadder (meaning it's decent for larger hands)	
236	pos	- There are included weoghts allowing for adjustment based on personal preference	
236	pos	I find certain mice to be too light, so the option for additional weight is personally greatly appreciated	
236	pos	All in all:This mouse is a great choice for the most seasoned veterans of gaming and the new-comers alike	
237	neg	Sometimes the mouse would stop being recognized in my windows 10 pro 64bit 20H2 system	
237	pos	This mouse is faster and more responsive than my previous one, which was the Gamdias Ourea mouse	
237	pos	Software and drivers work perfectly and the support is excellent	
237	pos	Highly recommend this mouse for all your gaming needs	
238	pos	The software is intiutive and doesn't feel bloated	
238	pos	Has everything you need to control RGB, DPI and other settings	
238	pos	I love the option of customizeable weights	
238	pos	Highly recommend for this price range	
239	neg	But expect to have to buy a new one every year because the switches for the left and right click wear out and start double clicking shortly after a year of normal use	
239	neg	Issue is, you can only click a certain number of times before it's deemed defective or not	
239	neg	Mine was having an issue, but not reliably enough to be caught by their check so I wasn't able to exchange the mouse	
239	pos	This is a great mouse	
239	pos	Very responsive and comfortable	
240	neg	I am extremely disappointed with this mouse	
240	neg	Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked	
240	neg	Now even that doesn't work	
240	neg	The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click	
240	neg	In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button	
240	neg	It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing	
240	neg	Words cannot begin to express my disappointment	
240	neg	It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident	
240	neg	I do not intend to buy this mouse ever again	
241	pos	No double clicking, very "hefty" feeling (not heavy as in "I can't move the mouse quickly", but heavy as in "that feels sturdy and of good quality"), feels great to hold in my hand	
241	pos	You can also add or remove weights from the mouse to control how light you want it to be, which I think is really cool	
241	pos	I haven't programmed many of the buttons yet (I guess I'm lazy), but it does have the option for those shortcuts to be customized	
241	pos	If you're hesitant, I would definitely recommend this mouse	
242	neg	He is on his second mouse and told me that it is the worst mouse to buy since left click has a defect	
242	neg	I am on my third mouse and confirmed with him that my third mouse has a defect on left click as well	
242	neg	DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES OR ANY PC EDITING	
242	neg	This mouse will double click with a single click or when clicking and holding/dragging items it will not register or let the item go	
243	neg	Unfortunately when I lift off the pad to reposition during gaming it sometimes loses tracking for a moment and launches my view all over the place until it reestablishes tracking	
243	neg	I've searched for solutions and it seems to be an somewhat common issue with the Hero sensor	
243	neg	I wouldn't buy it, the new hero sensors dont live up to the hype and were going backwards in ergonomics	
243	pos	First off, this is a great mouse when it works properly	
243	pos	As for ergonomics, I would love to meet the person who decided to put the 2 dpi selector switches right next to the left click button	
244	neg	The right click on this mouse stopped functioning properly within 8 months	
244	neg	After two weeks of back and forth, providing a video of the problem, providing a picture with my ticket and serial, I get a message saying it's out of stock and to wait another 3 weeks	
245	pos	This one is even better with the ability to change the color and the new cable	
245	pos	My favorite is between this and the original r	
245	pos	With the thinner, lighter cable on the hero and the ability to change the lighting, it's near perfect for me	
246	neg	However, I am frustrated that after a little over a year, this mouse developed the same left click issues my last one (Logitech Wired Pro which also lasted a little over a year) did	
246	neg	Whenever I perform a single left click, it often clicks twice and when I hold the left mouse button to drag (like you do all the time in a strategy game or moving files around) it will regularly disengage as if I lifted my finger, even though I am not changing pressure	
246	neg	Nearly every time I single clicked a space in this text box, while writing this review, I selected the word next to the space like I double clicked or the entire paragraph like I triple clicked	
247	neg	It has an infamous problem where it gets stuck in an infinite loading screen after a fresh install or update	
248	neg	This normally wasn't an issue, but during games where you hold right click to aim, it made them unplayable	
248	pos	The mouse is heavy and feels very premium	
248	pos	It works just fine without any programs or special drivers, but I recommend the GHUB program since you can customize the sensitivity more precisely	
249	neg	Right-click does not hold consistently, frequently unpressing/pressing the button while you hold it down	
249	neg	It gets a lot worse if you right-click and drag	
249	neg	Unacceptable for any game that relies on this	
249	neg	Both left and right click buttons will frequently double-click when you single-click	
249	neg	Awful for moments where double-click confirms, or when you mean to click+drag and it double-clicks instead	
249	neg	But this is absolutely awful for gaming anything that requires left/right-click precision and consistency	
249	pos	Pointer precision and response is good, it's ergonomic, wheel works (for me but I've read others having issues with it) - everything else with the mouse is fine	
251	neg	****They recently moved away from LGS to some ghub TERRIBLE software	
251	neg	Incredibly unintuitive and clunky to use	
251	neg	They will map on the software but they will not register on any application, not even a word document	
251	pos	Everything is working great	
251	pos	GREAT MOUSE	
251	pos	This mouse feels great in my hand and the weights are a great option to fit this thing just right	
252	neg	My only complaint is the positioning of navigation buttons	
252	neg	Sometimes I bump the dpi setting buttons against the side of my keyboard if I run out of room, but that's on me for not allowing enough space	
252	pos	This mouse is comfortable and precise	
252	pos	The G glows too, and you can change the color	
252	pos	Aside from that, it's everything I want in a mouse	
252	pos	My favorite feature is the mouse wheel is unlockable	
252	pos	You've got your normal clicky mouse wheel scrolling, but you can unlock it to make the wheel free-spinning	
252	pos	This is extremely useful in any game with a semi-auto weapon and a high fire rate (faster than you can normally click)	
254	neg	This mouse has a design flaw	
254	neg	The first mouse survived 6 months	
254	neg	The second survived 4	
254	neg	For me the failure mode has been if I hold down the left mouse button, it can randomly register multiple clicks while the button is held down	
254	neg	It's a shame	
254	pos	The G502 feels great in my hand	
254	pos	The software isn't anything special, but it works fine	
254	pos	I've bought Logitech mice for about 2 decades now and they've always done well for me until now	
255	neg	Sounds and looks cheap	
255	neg	Mouse tracks well but tends to reset its settings on reboot	
255	neg	They get dirty and kink and frey	
255	pos	Mouse wheel is highest quality part	
256	neg	the only downside i had with this mouse is that the top left 2 keys are a bit harder to reach as well as the one on the top, but i usually use them for the likes of music\volume controlls becasue the other 3 are more than enough	
256	pos	software works great with it, and it feels a lot more responsive in games than other mice	
256	pos	its also cool to have people look at it and get confused by the alien shape	
256	pos	free scroll wheel is extremely satisfying and i find myself unlocking it every so often to play with it like a fidget spinner	
256	pos	definitely a 5/5	
257	pos	It glides easier and is more responsive than my old mouse, which should be a good thing	
258	pos	I've been lucky so far with the mouse scroll wheel still working	
258	pos	The extra mouse buttons helps with secondary roles like switching optics and fire select modes	
258	pos	Very comfortable mouse to use and the Logitech app is very easy to use and navigate	
258	pos	Mouse clicks are light and with a positive tactile click	
259	neg	my logitech mouse left mouse pointer button slowly stopped registering input	
259	neg	at first it was here and there then got worse and worse eventually i had to buy a new mouse	
259	neg	Now i own the logitech hero 502 and after a little over a year it has begun doing the same thing	
260	neg	I really like the mouse but days after I purchased it, the right mouse button was intermittent and not consistent(I'm not hard on my hardware and treat it with care)	
260	pos	Mouse has a great build quality, works well, feels good in the hand and is very responsive	
260	pos	The software is easy to use and navigate	
261	pos	This is just a great mouse for gaming and productivity	
261	pos	You can save different profiles to the mouse and switch between them depending on what you are doing	
261	pos	The hyperscroll wheel is a beast at helping get through long PDFs and Excel files at work	
261	pos	Also being able to switch sensitivity on the fly comes in handy too	
262	neg	Down side, when I add the included weights to it, the magnetic panel on the bottom can't close	
262	neg	I'm really disappointed in Logitech with this mouse	
262	pos	Nice mouse all in all	
262	pos	More buttons than I've found uses for yet, highly programmable	
262	pos	Better fit than most mice for large hands, but a perfectly sized mouse would still be a bit longer	
263	pos	I love this mouse	
263	pos	This mouse is really nice	
263	pos	Feels great and works well	
264	neg	Now with the newwer G502 Hero, they have made the G502 essentially flawless	
264	neg	The new mouse is basically flawless	
264	pos	Still works amazingly after now many many years	
264	pos	No issues with the sensor, rgb, or anything	
264	pos	I'd be surprised if anyone is on the edge with this mouse, it's entirely worth buying	
265	neg	Sometimes when I scroll down, stop the wheel and start moving the mouse around it would scroll up or down on it's own	
266	neg	Also had my key binds not work at all	
266	neg	The button layout on the side is kind of bad, you will have to reach for the bigger button because the forward and back buttons are set back	
266	neg	Sometimes the scroll wheel lags, currently have it set to switch weapons and sometimes doesn't switch right away	
266	pos	Pretty small mouse and quite heavy for the size	
267	neg	Cons:- The weight, yes, I know I stated it's weight is distributed very well	
267	pos	The click this mouse produces is so much better than other mice I've owned	
267	pos	- Adjustable weight- This mouse is heavier than some of my other mice but somehow the weight is distributed better	
267	pos	I highly recommend this mouse and to be honest any other mouse made by Logitech they're really good quality products and they're built to last	
268	neg	This mouse was great, until it started having a left click problem	
268	neg	It was registering plenty of extra clicks	
268	neg	I again expressed my dissatisfaction and that I need to use the mouse until the new one arrives	
269	pos	I've got pretty big hands and this mouse feels great to me	
269	pos	All the buttons are easy to reach without feeling like I have to stretch or pull my hand back	
269	pos	The ghub software is easy enough to work with	
269	pos	Overall, nothing but positive feedback from me	
269	pos	I don't think you'll find a better mouse at this price point	
270	pos	Got it for the amount of buttons and was surprised by the level of customization	
271	neg	The only issues that make these unreliable, is there is a defect that causes the left click to double click	
272	pos	I had many mice before this one, but I have to say that this one has won the gold medal so far	
272	pos	The quality feels nice, the clickiness is responsive, the setup is economical, and the bottoms are efficient	
273	neg	Also, the profiles can have a hard time sticking and being saved	
273	neg	This can be a bit frustrating with having to adjust your options every so often	
273	pos	I love this little guy	
273	pos	I love the ability to switch to different dpi on the spot or its ability to work on almost all surfaces — including bed sheets with lines on them or glass surfaces	
273	pos	I love the response and action on the buttons	
273	pos	I especially love the ergonomic positioning of the additional buttons and the ability to program all the buttons to macros or keyboard strokes	
274	neg	My main problem with this mouse is that it is too small for most grown men or adults who would wear size large gloves	
274	neg	This negates any ergonomic benefits because you have to grip it incorrectly	
274	pos	I love my Logitech mice and this one performs very well too	
274	pos	The software is simple and it tracks great on my mouse pad	
275	neg	Another major issue for me is the weight, it is way heavy for an FPS mouse	
275	pos	The mouse itself has good build quality, crisp clicks and a good amount of programmable buttons	
275	pos	Finally, the ergonomics is very counter intuitive	
276	neg	I have to press down pretty hard to keep it from slipping	
276	neg	It is just too slippery	
276	neg	This is especially problematic when gaming	
277	neg	The software, G-Hub is hot garbage	
277	neg	I had trouble getting some key combinations working as expected	
277	neg	That's disappointing	
277	pos	I like the adjustable weights	
277	pos	I was much happier with the size when I found a good weight for me	
278	pos	Overall this is a great mouse	
278	pos	Very happy	
279	neg	Disappointed at the quality	
279	pos	I loved the feel of the mouse	
279	pos	It fit my hand well	
279	pos	I liked being able to adjust the weight of the mouse	
279	pos	The software was alright	
279	pos	My previous Logitech mice lasted years of heavy gaming for hours each day before experiencing the same issues	
280	neg	My one complaint with it applies to every single gaming mouse I've ever used:  the mouse wheel doesn't have enough resistance, so when you use it as a button while gaming, it tends to roll forward or backward too, which has unintended consequences in 99% of games	
280	pos	A decent mouse for the money, lots of buttons	
280	pos	For normal computer use, it's outstanding	
281	pos	It just feels good	
281	pos	Just nothing but quality	
282	pos	Totally worth the 80$	
284	neg	There's no way any of these mice would have passed that test unless shortcuts were taken	
284	neg	Like many have posted here, after a while the mouse starts clicking 10 times for every 1 click you do	
284	neg	It starts to effect both left and right clicking	
284	neg	I can't even drag files on my comp anymore because it drops them or opens them up because it's registering me clicking 80 times	
285	pos	The big benefit to me is the adjustable weights	
285	pos	Overall, this mouse is incredible and there is nothing so far I can report to dislike about it	
285	pos	Highly recommended	
286	pos	It's a Logitech mouse, so it seems to be sturdy and functions well so far	
286	pos	Otherwise, it's a great mouse	
286	pos	Definetely still worth the money	
288	pos	This member of the 502 family, the Logitech G502 HERO, takes a great mouse (G502 Proteus Spectrum RGB Tunable) with a great heritage (G502 Proteus Core) and makes it even greater	
289	pos	This thing is pretty darn good	
289	pos	Very responsive without being touchy	
289	pos	Able to set the G keys to be any key I want them to be	
289	pos	Easy to do macros for gaming	
290	neg	After several months of use, left mouse button starts to register multiple click even though only one click pressed	
290	neg	This can be very frustrating when you need do an drag function, like dragging files to different folder or highlighted text	
291	neg	The only downside is that the software is required if you want any of the features	
292	neg	With both of the mouses, the left and right click would release randomly while I would have the button pressed down	
292	neg	Making it impossible to aim in FPS titles	
292	neg	At first I thought it was just a bad mouse the first time, but when I got a second one the same exact thing happened	
292	neg	Something is wrong with the build quality or the parts they use inside of this mouse	
292	neg	It worked great for a couple of months, and then the problems started	
292	pos	This mouse is amazing, until it isn't	
293	neg	The problem is the Logitech G Hub is absolute garbage software	
293	neg	Issues I've had include losing profiles, not switching profiles, hanging on firmware updates, graphical problems in the software, crashes, and just a general terrible UI and UX design	
293	pos	The mouse itself seems fine	
293	pos	It's reasonably comfortable and adjustable weight	
294	neg	This thing will let you down with double click issues within the first or second month of use, so you better look something else, save your money	
295	neg	Cons:-The mouse wheel is ridiculous, it spins like crazy, I struggle to model 3d or animate anything with this mouse, like just a touch and your camera/scroll is all the way up or down, so I'm at odds	
296	pos	Compare against several Razer mice and other Logitech mice, this is my favorite for gaming	
296	pos	Ergonomics are perfect(assuming you don't need it to be ambidextrous)	
296	pos	Three thumb keys and two extra index finger keys are perfect for assigning vital actions in a game	
296	pos	Adjustable sensitivity	
296	pos	Smooth or lock to click scroll wheel is a must have in every mouse	
297	neg	The only issue is that the design of the mouse makes it some what annoying to clean	
297	neg	Dirt and grime and accumulate within the textured triangles and can be very annoying to clean unless you are wiping it down daily	
297	pos	To put it simply, this mouse seems perfectly fine in terms of form and function	
298	pos	But this mouse is absolutely perfect for me	
298	pos	The thumb wrest on the side is perfect	
298	pos	The thumb buttons are also in a really good place, I never find myself accidently hitting any or finding I can't reach one, with the exception of the button furthest forward, but I never use that anyway	
299	neg	Has software/hardware issues	
299	neg	This makes me not be able to control my DPI	
299	neg	Super annoying	
299	pos	Seems like a nice mouse	
300	pos	the mouse is just so precise - aiming in video games is much steadier, and it helps me so much with productivity because i can move the mouse so quickly and not overshoot whatever I'm trying to click	
300	pos	it's also ergonomically so comfortable - my hands are quite large (can easily reach 10ths on a piano if that means anything to you), so a lot of mice feel a bit small to me	
300	pos	This mouse's shape somehow fits my hand comfortably, and the rubber sides make for a very nice grip	
300	pos	there's some extra things that aren't crucial to me but are nice, such as the RGB, adjustable weights, and scroll wheel free/notched toggle, but they're certainly appreciated	
301	pos	This mice is just so comfortable to hold in my hand	
301	pos	The grip on the mice is perfect for me, I can move this thing on my entire pad without a break, smoothly	
301	pos	Another thing never appealed to me was the weights	
301	pos	I popped them all in, and played around with the mouse for an hour or two, and honestly, I like it more than I thought I would	
302	pos	Customizable color RGB through the G Hub app as well	
302	pos	Gaming feels like a breeze with everything more precise, the buttons more responsive, and a clear rise in quality from my last model	
302	pos	I recommend this mouse to anyone who prefers a wired model and is looking for something to game with	
304	neg	Big cons IMO, the scroll wheel is absolute garbage	
304	neg	Buttons do not feel solid in any way	
305	neg	The other mouse was very light weighted and felt cheap	
305	pos	This is probably the best mouse I ever used	
305	pos	This is built like a brick and works amazingly	
305	pos	It gives a nice speed to the mouse	
305	pos	Lastly the mouse is fully custom with lighting with full rgb	
305	pos	So far this has been really great	
306	neg	The dpi buttons are in a bad places as I was always hitting one with my left figure and the adjustment of dpi was bad	
306	neg	The design of the mouse is not great as it is rounded on the right side so I was always lifting the mouse when moving right and losing movement on screen	
307	neg	This will manifest in either the mouse double clicking with a single press, or not being able to maintain a held press without registering additional clicks	
308	pos	Positives: Comfortable to hold, weighty, nice to the touch, cool lights, lots of features	
309	neg	after that, it started acting up with some random double-clicking and click+hold interruption	
310	neg	Second mouse had two issues, the right click button sometimes double clicks so if I am scoping in playing any FPS game, it will scope out or jitter	
310	neg	Super annoying	
310	neg	Like a tiny piece of the plastic sticks outwards and scratches the mouse pad	
310	neg	Anyway the ergonomics are actually trash	
310	neg	Some of the "extra" buttons are too easy to accidentally press	
310	neg	Boom accidentally touched like 4 buttons	
310	neg	The 2 extra buttons on the left mouse button are just too out of reach of the index finger	
311	neg	I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase	
311	neg	The mouse will randomly disconnect while I am in the middle of using it	
311	neg	The mouse will disconnect for about a second from my computer and reconnect again right after, but in the middle of gaming that is not acceptable	
312	pos	I’ve been looking for a nice gaming mouse, and if you are too, you can click Add to Cart	
312	pos	The Logitech G502 Hero works absolute wonders	
312	pos	For starters, the weight customization is amazing	
312	pos	You can change how heavy the mouse is to fit your own needs, and it comes with plenty of extra weights	
312	pos	It has a nice clicking sound and it’s easy to click fast on it	
312	pos	It also has a very nice scroll wheel, and overall it feels very sturdy and well-made	
312	pos	Logitech GHub is a simple install for this, and it is very user friendly	
312	pos	I have had no issues with it thus far, and it is likely my favourite accessory to my computer	
313	neg	Just under a year old and the double click/click and drag fail has begun	
313	neg	The problem is clicking, holding and dragging	
313	neg	The click releases and then clicks again while dragging	
313	neg	I have updated and still not working properly	
314	neg	The main con: The unlockable scroll wheel sort of moves a bit/creates a rattle if you move the mouse quickly, whether locked or unlocked	
314	pos	The weights are a cool concept (although I ended up only using one, usually I like light mice)	
315	neg	It's impossible to play games or even drag a window from one monitor to another	
315	pos	build quality is good and egos are great	
316	neg	Unfortunately, I have now experienced the constant click/double click issue	
316	neg	This creates a lot of issues with my gaming so I will be purchasing a different mouse to replace this one :(	
316	pos	I want to start by saying I love love love this mouse	
316	pos	Feels nice in my hand, love the weight adjustability option	
316	pos	For just every day use and playing my favorite games, this worked wonderful	
317	pos	Third, this mouse is incredibly budget friendly, especially when it's on sale	
317	pos	To be honest, I don't actually know how Razer and Corsair compete with this thing on the market	
317	pos	You will not be disappointed	
318	neg	However the software for the mouse is pretty poop	
318	neg	There were numerous bugs with the software, manually starting the Logitech app every time I boot up was pretty annoying after awhile	
318	neg	The same day the left click broke the rgb decided to go out	
318	neg	When I plugged it into a different port the port then shorted and broke the usb3 ports on the front of my computer	
318	pos	The mouse overall was decent while it lasted	
319	neg	I tried to just straighten the cord, but it kept deforming and causing high friction against the mouse pad	
319	pos	So yay, I finally have a nice mouse	
321	neg	Shame on Logitech for using this faulty design	
322	neg	The mouse wheel was either to tight or if I used the free wheel it was to loose	
322	neg	After fiddling with it I finally just threw it in the trash and replaced it with a $20 mouse	
323	neg	Not more than 4 months after I got it I started noticing the right click would "double click" when clicked once or it wouldn't hold a click either	
323	neg	Now 9 months later and the left click is going out too, whenever I click on the top of a window it double clicks for me maximizing the window	
324	pos	I didn't think the provided weights would be enough but they actually work well	
324	pos	I work 10+ hours a day with a lot of mouse use and this is a great mouse	
325	neg	For about a month and a half now, the left mouse button doesn't click properly, sometimes it doesn't single click, often it doesn't hold a click (i	
326	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button started double clicking when I was single clicking or attempting to click and drag	
326	neg	Within 2 months the new mouse had the same issue	
327	neg	This issue is called double-clicking and is well documented with this mouse	
329	pos	The mouse is otherwise functional, nice shape and feel	
330	neg	the ergonomics are not great, it is very flat and long compared to other ergo mice i have	
330	pos	The only positive is the easy to program buttons	
331	pos	I love the ability to add or remove the extra weights as needed	
331	pos	The Logitech G hub software is easy to find and download, this is the app that allows to easily change advanced settings like LED color/brightness, and most importantly to customize the programmable buttons	
332	pos	The mouse itself is fine	
333	neg	First off, it was really easy to hit the wheel left or right while scrolling, which could make my browser switch tabs	
333	neg	It was also difficult to click the wheel without it registering as a lateral movement	
333	neg	The odd curves were really uncomfortable and caused some pretty intense cramps in my hand after little use	
334	neg	The app's interface is also awful	
336	neg	In addition, a single & long click is considered as double-click for some reason	
337	neg	I cant click a tab and drag it	
338	pos	DPI setting flexibility is great	
338	pos	Tracks very smoothly and I like the weights	
338	pos	A heavier mouse feels better for some reason	
339	neg	Mouse is randomly double clicking both left and right	
340	neg	The click and hold fails often now	
340	pos	Initially this is a really great mouse	
340	pos	It has very smooth control, finely tunable speeds, easy to access buttons, easy to understand lighting controls and DPI schemes	
341	pos	The scroll wheel lock is an awesome feature, and while the locked-wheel is a bit more clunky than I'd like, the unlocked wheel rolls around with ease	
341	pos	Such a nice feature	
343	neg	The G502 is unfortunately not compatible with the older Logitech Gaming Software	
343	pos	The build quality of the G502 is nice	
344	neg	Unfortunately, yesterday it started having an issue where it registers a single click or a click and drag as a double click	
344	neg	I use this mouse for CAD, graphic design, and gaming so this issue is quite debilitating	
346	neg	I'm not sure how this mouse is so highly rated if this is such a blatantly obvious manufacturers defect	
346	neg	Go with a different brand	
346	neg	Yes, the mouse is flashy and fun and has a lot of features, but go with something made with better quality materials	
347	neg	I have very small hands, and the struggle is real when it comes to finding a gaming mouse	
347	neg	Cons: Still fairly large for my hand	
347	neg	I think my biggest dislike is the convoluted and confusing software (Logitech Hub) that doesn't really give you clear instructions on how to use it	
347	pos	Pros: Comfortable	
347	pos	Adjustable weight	
347	pos	High quality build	
347	pos	Customizable dpi presets	
347	pos	Customizable rgb backlighting	
347	pos	Overall, I'm very pleased with this mouse choice so far	
348	pos	Great mouse with many options	
348	pos	Makes gaming easier with greater detail (compared to my old mouse)	
348	pos	Very comfortable rubberized outer shell	
348	pos	Really nice options	
349	neg	BUT if you have a wide hand (my palm is about 3 3/4 in wide) and use a palm gripping style this mouse is not for you	
349	neg	I find it to be too narrow, both my middle and pinky fingers are dragging on the pad any my index is constantly activating the +DPI button when I am pressing button 1 (this was so bad I disabled the +DPI button altogether)	
349	neg	I tried to like this mouse: worked and gamed with it for a week, but it's going back :(	
349	pos	First I will say this is a quality gaming mouse	
349	pos	It's well built, glides great on a hard mousepad	
349	pos	buttons have a nice feel	
350	neg	Other times, the mouse would release a click while I was trying to drag something, which led to a lot of misplaced files, and unintended highlighting of text	
350	neg	I'm very unhappy with the quality of the hardware here, despite the device's many positive aspects	
350	neg	I'd advise buyers to avoid this mouse, because this appears to be a widespread issue	
350	pos	I was very happy with it for the first three months; customizable buttons using the Logitech software was a breeze, and I loved the feel of the device	
351	neg	I find this useful as I am always switching back and forth between the keyboard and mouse and sometimes I need quick actions on the mouse, this mouse can do that	
351	pos	It is labeled as a gaming mouse but it is a great mouse in general for every day use	
351	pos	It is ergonomic, comfortable and smooth while moving	
351	pos	The scroll wheels is one of the best I have ever used, it has two modes, a free scroll and a normal scroll	
351	pos	Good when you like to scroll easily and sometimes bad when you move to another window and it keeps scrolling but that's mostly user error fault, not of the mouse	
351	pos	The customization is crazy	
351	pos	You can configure the 11 buttons to do all different things, not just the default mouse options	
351	pos	Overall a great mouse and I highly recommend, the quality and feature-set is unmatched to any other mouse I have used	
353	neg	I have to say tho, this is probably not a mouse for people with small hands	
353	pos	I've had this mouse for a year now and I have no complaints whatsoever about it	
353	pos	The software works great and I'm not an RGB fanatic so I really appreciate the simple accents on the mouse that I can customize	
353	pos	I also love how I can make different profiles for different applications, mostly games, and how customizable the whole mouse is	
353	pos	But for me, it fits comfortably in my hand has stood up to some abuse really well	
353	pos	Overall, an amazing mouse that I could confidently recommend to anyone who wants a high-quality mouse or one with the extra buttons	
354	pos	Like many others around here I have had a lot of issue with this mouse	
355	neg	This makes scrolling the wheel a bit uncomfortable and it FEELS like it's imprecise	
355	pos	I've owned Logitech products for years and have always been very happy	
355	pos	This mouse is no exception	
355	pos	All in all it's a great mouse, built well, look good	
356	pos	Light, good amount of buttons and a temporary DPI change button	
356	pos	Very responsive, and a good amount of cord	
356	pos	Once connected and with G Hub installed, you can customize and change the mouse G color as you want	
356	pos	Tracks fine so matter the DPI	
356	pos	G Hub has gotten better and makes it easy to fine tune the mouse	
356	pos	Bottom pops off easily if you want to add weights	
357	pos	I loved that mouse as someone who uses a full palm grip and has larger hands	
357	pos	I was recommended the g502 from multiple people and read about it as a replacement on multiple sites	
357	pos	The mouse does good clicky things, all the buttons feel solid and the mouse is responsive	
357	pos	I think this mouse is probably an amazing mouse with someone with smaller hands, or someone who prefers a claw grip	
358	pos	Solid mouse for any gamer, very accurate and easily customizable	
358	pos	Works amazing with my Xbox One and my PC	
358	pos	Software is very intuitive and great to use	
358	pos	Buttons are easily programmable and useful for games where having immediate access to a command is crucial	
358	pos	Would recommend 100%	
358	pos	One of my favorite mice of all time	
359	neg	Needless to say I'm likely to buy another mouse but I'm not so sure it'll be another Logitech at this point	
360	pos	I would love to give this mouse a 5, but there’s just a couple small things	
360	pos	It is just a tad too small, but then I have relatively big hands, so if it doesn’t fit like a glove that’s okay	
360	pos	The rest of the mouse could be a little more metal, as most of it is plastic	
360	pos	Over all I recommend this, it’s a very nice clicky mouse wheel, so swapping to the desired secondary/ primary/ heavy on destiny is easy	
361	neg	One flaw I would like to point out would be the feet on this mouse	
361	pos	Also the sensor is wonderful and can be adjusted up to 16000 dpi which no ordinary human would need	
361	pos	If you have larger hands and like the feeling of a hefty mouse this is a valid contender as I’ve come to enjoy using it very much	
362	neg	Never understood the need for LEDs	
362	pos	I thought it will be cool to use a mouse my 17 year old nephew suggested, but I forgot my age	
362	pos	In the haste of being a new age nerd, I bought a heavy mouse meant for gamers with cool leds	
362	pos	It’s a smooth mouse and heavy heavy one (not like of your dumbbells 😀 though)	
362	pos	I love it	
362	pos	It wakes up my Mac mini whenever I want and moves smoothly across the display	
362	pos	So in summary, a great mouse for a gamer and a very good one for everyone else	
363	neg	I bought this as it was recommended for people with larger hands in a number of reviews, but it is definitely made for smaller hands	
363	neg	My hands are not really that big, but my thumb doesn't even fit into the thumb groove	
363	neg	Using this, I'd have to switch from a palm grip to a finger grip, so I'll keep looking	
363	neg	Also, when you set the mouse wheel to "click" mode, it really is difficult to scroll the wheel up	
364	pos	I also use this often why playing Xbox one with my pc friends on cod modern warfare	
365	neg	I can concur with other reviewers that this mouse over time develops left click issues	
365	neg	Namely in my case dragging windows is a point of endless frustration as this mouse constantly drops the window	
365	neg	Lo and behold here I am a year later wishing I'd just bought a different Mouse	
365	neg	I've been using Logitech mouses for 15+ years and these two mice are the only ones I have had an issue with	
365	neg	They won't get me a third time	
365	pos	Double clicks have been noticed as well	
366	neg	It is a bit on the heavy side; however, this is not a bother to me	
366	neg	I see a lot of other people complaining about it	
366	pos	This mouse is extremely well made	
366	pos	I quite like using it	
366	pos	It is highly customizable and it feels great in your hand	
366	pos	The texture on it is excellent	
366	pos	It fits in my average sized hands perfectly	
366	pos	I can click all the buttons with ease	
366	pos	It's still light enough to turn on some bots	
366	pos	The software for this mouse really is not that bad either	
366	pos	It's easy to navigate and customize the mouse	
366	pos	All in all, I love this mouse for gaming	
367	neg	It is way too complicated for the various modes- I am still trying to figure out the DPI modes, and then the left click starts failing	
367	neg	Won't hold fire, won't fire 100% first click	
367	neg	So I know I have been gaming like crazy due to this covid crap, but for $50 I expect a gazillion clicks	
367	neg	Could do without umpteen levels of DPI variation- the Corsair was much, much easier to use	
367	neg	Going through Logitech warranty now	
368	pos	These mice are the perfect shape, rgb, weights	
369	neg	Terrible, I will never get another one	
369	neg	It stopped working after 3 weeks	
369	neg	I tried all of the troubleshooting tips, (e	
369	neg	So no more Logitech garbage for me	
369	pos	I put my old razor mouse back in and it works fine	
369	pos	I am very pleased that Amazon did refund my money though	
369	pos	So kudos to Amazon for the refund	
370	pos	It has such a massive DPI range for anyone looking to fine tweak it, a G Huh app that can reassign buttons and functions and even change the backlight on your mouse	
370	pos	The build quality and weight is truly what makes this feel like no other	
370	pos	premium, to me	
371	neg	If it does break, the hoops Logitech customer service wants you to jump through are ridiculous	
372	neg	to our surprise he keeps complaining that the left button does not work properly and that it makes a really weird noise	
372	neg	I tried to help him and see if I could fix the issue as it is obvious and unfortunately we cant	
372	pos	truly feel taken advantage off	
373	neg	I have to admit, the fact that there are so many buttons on this mouse made it seem incredibly dumb	
373	pos	The scroll wheel is honestly a life changer	
373	pos	The latter is definitely beneficial for someone like me who looks at too many spreadsheets every day	
373	pos	10/10 product, the size and shape are great and don't feel cheap and my god that scroll wheel	
374	pos	its definitely a great buy considering how long my electronics usually last, iv had corsair, razer, roccat, and hyperx	
374	pos	I'm no stranger to Logitech considering iv been buying their products for a long time	
374	pos	great settings to fit my reactive gaming needs as well as matching aesthetic to my keyboard	
374	pos	definitely worth the money	
375	neg	So I bought a new one	
375	pos	The first one lasted almost 2 years	
376	pos	But I was shocked to find how comfortable it feels in my hand	
376	pos	The weights too are a great feature and easy to install compared to the Rival 600	
376	pos	This is definitely a good mouse, feels very clean when aiming and very comfy	
377	neg	CON # 1: The shape of the this is unusual	
377	neg	I do not recommend this mouse if you rest your wrist on a wrist pad because it lifts your palm a little off of the mouse	
377	neg	The mouse is too narrow to hold the mouse between your thumb and ring and pink fingers	
378	neg	The issue I have is that it's heavy	
378	neg	The additional weight comes into play when making fine movements with just the fingers	
378	pos	Love logitech products	
378	pos	They're usually top quality and work very well	
378	pos	This is a good looking mouse, top quality and works very well	
379	neg	left click failed on all 3 after about 3-4 month of normal usage, no heavy gaming done	
379	neg	Left click does NOT hold after a few month of usage	
379	neg	I do not recommend and cannot recommend people getting this mouse as this product is EXTREMELY unreliable	
380	pos	This one was great, it did everything I wanted it to and even the extra buttons to setup proper profiles was perfect	
382	neg	It was only occasional at first, and sometimes would stop doing it if I clicked the mouse button in a different way, but over the past few weeks it's getting worse and worse	
382	neg	In just this past week now my left mouse button is starting to become unusable, for example I could be using a fully auto weapon and click left mouse button to shoot, only for it to shoot one bullet	
382	neg	Even more frustrating is I can't even drag my browsers from one monitor to the other because it just doesn't detect that I'm holding the mouse button down, it acts like I'm only clicking it	
382	pos	It's a real shame, I love this mouse, personally it fits perfectly in my hand and I love the way it feels but after about 6 months of use, the right mouse button started double clicking	
383	neg	Don't buy it, you will regret it	
383	neg	Listen to the naysayers, the product is just of a purely inferior quality	
384	neg	The only drawback is the scroll - it's too loose like what other reviewers said	
384	pos	I like it a lot	
384	pos	Ergonomic, easy clicks, scrolls, size, customizable buttons with working software	
385	pos	The quality seems great and the mouse is sleek and responsive	
387	neg	My number one complaint is that the scroll wheel isn't rubberized and is metal, so my fingertip tends to slide on it too easily (especially on cold/dry days)	
387	neg	Feels a little small in my hand and slightly awkward	
387	neg	I tend to accidentally click the precision buttons when trying to click primary	
387	pos	Ultimately, I'm very satisfied with this mouse	
387	pos	However, I looooove the de-click button	
387	pos	But all-in-all I'm pretty pleased with it	
388	neg	Just like a lot of people have mentioned, it will ultimately result in double click issues (very common)	
388	neg	It is slightly heavier than a normal mouse	
388	pos	In addition, this mouse is more suitable for those who do a full grip and have larger hands	
388	pos	Regardless, this mouse is great in features such as weight adjustment with several mouse buttons	
389	pos	if yes, this is a great choice for gaming or other usage as well	
389	pos	very comfortable for my claw grip	
389	pos	the weights let you get exactly the feel you want	
389	pos	the sensor is very sensitive and responsive	
390	pos	With all the weights installed the weight it's OK	
390	pos	The button placement is pretty good	
391	pos	I love this mouse	
391	pos	This mouse comes with weights and the bottom comes off so you can add them to your liking	
391	pos	The scroll wheel can be unlocked and can spin freely	
392	neg	It does have some click issues here and there, but I did travel with it for a couple years without a case	
392	pos	I now own 2 of these and they are without a doubt the best mouse I've ever had	
392	pos	New one is just as good	
392	pos	Adjustable weight is super dope too	
392	pos	1000% recommend	
393	neg	It's a full-sized mouse and good for those with large hands or larger fingers	
393	pos	And it feels nice	
393	pos	And there's a button to lock or unlock free spin mode	
393	pos	Then it has this cool thumb button for changing the DPI to a preset	
394	neg	I've never been so insulted by a company this much	
394	neg	Looks like a really common issue is that the middle mouse button "click" will just break after a month or two of use	
394	neg	DO NOT BUY FROM LOGITECH	
395	pos	This mouse has weights for you to customize how heavy you would like it	
395	pos	There are also customizable buttons for you to program	
395	pos	Gaming with this mouse is very smooth and my hand doesn't typically get tired	
396	pos	Fit and feel, just like a good hand gun	
397	neg	The only thing I can complain about is how the gaming profiles work on this mouse	
398	neg	I would not recommend using this as a gaming mouse but it would be decent at best for everyday use	
398	neg	If you have large to xl hands this is not for you	
399	neg	This mouse is way way to complicated to use and frankly don't have the time nor do I want to spend the time deciphering how to use this damn thing	
399	neg	Just trash	
399	neg	I pay good money for a premium product I cant even enjoy because it takes a college course to learn how to use	
400	pos	But it’s a great mouse, I love the free spin selection on the mouse wheel	
400	pos	Anyways, it’s a great gaming mouse	
401	neg	I'll be going out today to buy a new one and will definitely avoid getting another Logitech	
402	neg	The only thing I am still not sure about is if I should have gone with the wireless Lightspeed model	
402	neg	It is one reason I like the trackpad, but trackpad's are not good for gaming	
402	pos	It is a very nice mouse	
402	pos	So, this mouse is well made and nice to hold	
402	pos	The buttons are placed well for average hands	
402	pos	I have decided I like all the weights loaded, it has a good solid feel that way	
402	pos	Highly recommended	
404	neg	Not for large hands	
405	neg	I’m pretty disappointed	
406	neg	Compared to my old mouse it feels cheap	
406	neg	It also doesn't slide as smoothly on my mouse pad and it has thrown me off to a small degree	
406	pos	The ergonomics are almost perfect for my hand	
406	pos	The only issue holding it back from a 5 star review is material quality	
407	neg	But the reason this is a low star review is because the when the mouse feet on my unit came off and the sensor started randomly flicking upward	
407	neg	In total this was a waste of the money I spent on it, and I cant even take advantage of my warranty	
407	pos	In total it had been a great mouse for the price	
408	neg	It's too small for my borderline medium to large hands	
408	neg	For me, there is simply no good way to hold it and have decent control	
408	neg	I won't be able to use it because of the size and I don't recommend anyone with large size or bigger hands to get this mouse	
408	pos	I gave it 4 stars because it's of a high build quality and the sensor tracks great	
409	neg	The RGB lighting is not the best	
409	neg	Overall, the RGB is no bad at all, it's just not great	
409	pos	From the numerous customizable buttons, weight variation, and RGB lighting, your mouse will look good, feel good, and play good	
409	pos	For my personal playing style, the weight adjustment is the best feature	
409	pos	Some like a lighter mouse but I like mine a little heavier	
410	pos	This mouse checked all those boxes, and for a good price	
410	pos	Additionally, there is a button on the mouse that lets you switch how the scroll works, which is nice at time	
411	neg	The scroll wheel doesn’t feel accurate/natural	
411	pos	I’ve owned multiple gaming mouses from different brands, and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable using this mouse	
412	neg	The mouse worked fine for approximately one month before it suddenly stopped functioning	
412	neg	The mouse was dead	
413	neg	This mouse has double click issues within less than 1 year time frame typically	
413	neg	The switch is poor quality	
413	neg	Logtiech click quality is the problem with this mouse	
413	pos	So i recommend to any user that reads a happy 4/5 star review of this mouse, either is by a user who doesn't play games or reviewed the mouse to early	
413	pos	Material/shape of mouse and weight options are good	
416	neg	This product was a horrible purchase, and has eroded many years of trust I had in Logitech products	
416	pos	I bought this mouse to replace a $15 chinese mouse that worked perfectly for 3 years	
417	neg	At this point, I will stay away from any Logitech mice as they seem to not be really lasting long anymore	
417	neg	It is just a waste of money and time	
417	pos	They look great, they feel great and I have no complaints on how they respond when they work	
418	neg	The mouse is too small for my hand, if you have a big hand you'll find that you have a difficult time gripping this thing like I do	
418	pos	The mouse is great quality, I love the weights you can add or remove from the bottom	
419	neg	I was really disappointed with the design of the scroll wheel	
420	neg	Unfortunately, this mouse does not respect mouse sensitivity customization correctly	
420	neg	The default setting for this mouse is incredibly sensitive, and hard to work with	
420	neg	After searching for solutions to the this on DuckDuckGo, I see that others have had similar problems for over a year, and there does not appear to be any solution	
420	neg	Even though I have had success with other Logitech products, I regret buying this mouse from them	
421	neg	The problem is that after some time lmb starts to lose its ability to detect touch, clicking and dragging stopped working, it would unclick itself and then re click itself as I held down	
421	neg	Talked to one of my friends and they had a similar issue	
422	pos	I like the unlockable scroll wheel a very cool feature along with the dpi shift	
422	pos	Great option with added weights for your preference	
423	pos	The design is great and has a great feel on my hand	
423	pos	The RGB is also a nice touch to go with the rest of my set up	
423	pos	Would highly recommend	
424	neg	However the thumb clicks on the side is very very low so when a grab the mouse my thumb is resting on the side buttons and it makes it unusable for me since while gaming i am hitting one of this buttons and causing to cancel of what im doing and do what i have assign on it	
424	pos	Wished i could of use this mouse it seams very nice	
425	neg	However, I had a ton of issues with this mouse cycling profile, switching to onboard memory, randomly disconnecting, forgetting bindings and reverting to default settings mid game	
425	neg	Nothing fixed the issues	
425	neg	I was about to return the mouse and try a different product and manufacturer all together despite really liking the physical product	
425	pos	The physical mouse itself is very nice	
425	pos	Fits well in my hand, comfortable to use, nice button placement for the most part	
425	pos	Mouse works great now	
425	pos	No issues whatsoever	
425	pos	For most this would probably be a non-issue	
426	neg	Small problem that creates quite a bit of frustration	
428	neg	This one lasted 6 months	
428	neg	The bad: After 6 months, the mouse doesn't generate a steady "click-and-hold" signal anymore, and sometimes a single click generates several rapid clicks instead	
428	neg	Probably going to buy from a new brand, now	
428	pos	The good: the ergonomics are great and the mouse manages to fit my monster-sized hands	
428	pos	I love the tune-able weights	
428	pos	The laser is quality and what I expect from Logitech's gaming offerings	
428	pos	The wheel's free-spin mode is awesome	
429	pos	This is the most comfortable mouse I've ever held	
429	pos	The mouse itself is a little on the heavier side but it's perfect for me even without the extra weights	
429	pos	The extra weights are a really nice touch	
429	pos	The mouse is beautiful the rgb in the G can be changed to any color on the colorwheel, sniper button is a really good thing to have when gaming, I need to get used to using it though	
429	pos	The dpi buttons are set up in a good place, easy to reach when needed	
429	pos	The app is easy to use to set up all the defaults, though some things are a bit confusing	
429	pos	Overall an amazing mouse, couldn't have asked for better	
430	neg	That's when I noticed an issue with the way the mouse clicks and drags	
430	neg	First the left button would double click, then the right button wouldn't maintain a constant click	
430	pos	The mouse is an awesome looking mouse that has a lot of customizability	
430	pos	I bought my first one back in Aug of 2019 and it was great	
431	neg	It was so frustrating I finally stopped using it	
433	neg	It is VERY frustrating, you will double-click unintentionally due to hardware defects in this mouse	
433	neg	You will also be unable to click/drag	
433	neg	The mouse will do unintentional actions which are difficult to undo	
433	neg	Very disappointing from Logitech	
433	neg	DO NOT BUY this mouse	
434	pos	I can add weights, making it feel more solid	
434	pos	Also the scroll wheel release button is SUPER unique; lets the scroll wheel fly	
435	pos	Very ergonomic and comfortable	
436	neg	PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY BECAUSE THE GHUB SOFTWARE THAT PROGRAMS THE BUTTONS IS HOT GARBAGE	
436	pos	The mouse has a great feel to it and with the adjustable weights can be made to feel even better	
436	pos	The Ghub Software has been fixed and updated, making this mouse extremely worthwhile	
436	pos	If you ever needed a great mouse or a new replacement mouse THIS IS THE ONE	
439	neg	This mouse is quite large and has a contour on the right side that can cause your hand to slide off	
439	neg	I don't care for the contour however because it causes my hand to slide to that side and doesn't support my fingers over there	
441	pos	The overall design is very sleek with a gamer focused appeal	
442	neg	I understand the hype, but the scroll wheel is atrocious	
442	neg	The free wheel is ok but the tactile wheel feels bad	
443	pos	It's lightweight, the ergonomics just feel right and the button placement is fantastic	
443	pos	In the grand scheme it's a pretty cheap mouse for how great it is, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good mouse	
444	pos	Very useful	
445	neg	I can't even click and drag	
445	pos	All the things are great	
445	pos	I loved this mouse, and told many people about it	
446	pos	Fits perfectly in the palm of my hand	
446	pos	Love it very much and I'll buy it again if I ever need another	
447	pos	Overall I'm happy with the performance and given that I use this as my daily mouse for work, I'm okay with it developing issues after 3+ years of constant use	
447	pos	The mouse glides very smoothly and the included weights allow you to fine-tune how you like your mouse to feel	
447	pos	The mouse comes with plenty of buttons and the Logitech software makes it very easy to customize what they do	
447	pos	The RGB lights add some good looks although I typically have it turned off	
449	pos	Given the shape, I find it kind of hard to sit my hand on it naturally in a way that can reach all the buttons	
449	pos	Overall seems like a pretty nice wired mouse	
451	neg	The only thing I dont like is that the profiles can be switched on the mouse with a button, colors and all (which is very cool	
451	pos	I love everything they sell	
451	pos	Quality products that look good, feel good, and work good	
451	pos	Has synching LEDs that can be paired with other Logitech gear and there is a neat magnetic panel underneath where the weights go	
452	pos	I liked the idea of extra buttons on the G502 and they seem all reachable	
452	pos	Also seems to be mechanical improvement to DPI setting buttons, which you can reprogram per game if you want	
452	pos	So far, this has been a really nice upgrade	
452	pos	The game moves exactly where I put the cursor in a way I can't explain other than "tracking" being excellent	
453	pos	I love so much about this mouse	
453	pos	The weights are probably my favorite part, being able to adjust that per game and need is amazing	
453	pos	I love the ability to have rough or loose scrolling on the wheel	
453	pos	Easy to clean too (games, clean yo dang mice, human hands be gross	
456	neg	However, it quickly built up a static charge that prevents the buttons from working properly	
456	neg	When the buttons are held down, they randomly click every few seconds or so, which completely destroys the gameplay for which it was intended	
456	neg	Overall, I'm very disappointed with the mouse	
456	pos	The five buttons were convenient, and the ability to customize its weight may appeal to some	
456	pos	The backlighting is kind of cool	
457	neg	It's not as comfortable to use as my old school Logitech G9 mouse, but that could well be because I've been using it for 10 years	
457	neg	It just isn't comfortable for my grip/hand placement	
457	pos	Well played	
458	neg	-Cons--Less ergonomic	
458	neg	-Awkwardly positioned DPI buttons, next to the left mouse button	
458	neg	I am constantly hitting them by accident, which is annoying	
459	neg	Overall this mouse may be a bit ugly and pricey, but it’s made for gaming and not looks	
459	pos	When the mouse was ready, using it was amazing as I felt a noticeable difference from Razer mouses	
459	pos	The quality is great for the price, and i’m happy with it	
460	neg	Button profile sticks, only actual issue I've noticed is that sometimes the LEDs go factory default after the system comes out of standby	
461	pos	It's ergonomic, lightweight (or weighted with the included weights), and has easily programmable software and hardware profiles	
462	neg	BAD:The mouse wheel is horrible; it an infinite scroll that can be toggles	
462	neg	Scroll wheel makes it not usable for gaming	
462	pos	GOOD: I really want to like the mouse	
462	pos	The sensor is great and the feel of the mouse in my hands is great	
462	pos	The weight adjustment is also a strong positive	
462	pos	The logitech software works great and makes this mouse very resourceful	
462	pos	Overall:Good mouse, but not susceptible for what its advertised	
463	pos	It seems to work great both for work and gaming	
464	neg	The con is the button that unlocks the scroll wheel, the button sometimes goes half way and appears to be stuck, but if you press on it using a little bit more force the first time, this doesn't happen	
464	pos	This will allow you to edit most of the options of this mouse	
465	pos	Overall this mouse is amazing, best gaming mouse I've ever owned	
465	pos	I love everything from the size, the button layout, to even the adjustable weight	
466	pos	Reposnce is amazing	
466	pos	Love the product and highly supported it	
467	neg	After a few months, one of the side buttons started making a weird double-clicky sound and had a real strange tactile feel when clicking	
467	pos	It's a nice mouse	
468	pos	Otherwise it is top quality that I expect from Logitech	
469	pos	The controls are great for changing sensitivity and the weights are useful for setting the weight	
469	pos	The best feature by far is the scroll wheel	
472	neg	The problem is that it is nearly impossible to click the middle mouse button without "accidentally" clicking the middle left/right button instead	
473	neg	However, I read the reviews and knew that this investment wasn’t gonna be the best because so many people had issues	
473	neg	Honestly, y’all better off spending ya money on something similar but not logitech, cause I don’t think they really care about the production of their products	
473	pos	I really like this mouse	
474	neg	The wheel doesn't catch, as other reviews have described as well, making it terrible for gaming and for general reading of the web (if you use the center scroll wheel to move down and up pages)	
475	neg	Out of nowhere, it started to double click all on it's own	
475	neg	This effectively rendered the mouse 100% useless for gaming	
475	pos	I absolutely loved this mouse while it was working correctly	
475	pos	It was responsive, the button layout was fantastic, and the weight was almost perfect for what I needed	
476	pos	It feels great, materials used were solid and sturdy enough to last you throughout long gaming sessions(Generally 8-12 hours)	
477	neg	This is not for people with small hands at all	
477	neg	My mouse would not actuate the click because of poor quality control on the moldings so gaming was horrific and holding Left Mouse button down is nearly impossible	
478	pos	This mouse is great	
478	pos	I did have a little fun playing with the RGB, but mostly I just wanted a mouse that would bounce easily between productivity and gaming and this one checks all the boxes	
479	pos	The moment I unboxed this and held it, I could clearly feel and see how high quality the components are	
479	pos	Left and right click have a certain smoothness to them that I haven't felt on another mouse	
479	pos	The infinite scroll wheel is dope and has already changed the game for my mindless reddit scrolling	
479	pos	I also like that the scroll wheel is made of metal, it just feels nice when you rotate it and feel the snap when it's not on the infinite scroll setting	
479	pos	Finally, this thing offers a sensor that is as smooth as butter	
479	pos	Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice mouse for a better daily grind or gaming with a comp	
480	neg	The only problem with it is that the bottom gamma off all the time	
480	pos	I love the mouse	
481	pos	All buttons feel like they’re in the perfect place	
481	pos	I recommended this to my good friend and he agrees it’s the best mouse he’s owned	
481	pos	Would definitely recommend	
482	neg	Thought it was just me but after testing two other mice and with two separate machines, this mouse left click is constantly cutting out, skipping and has terrible input lag	
484	pos	Absolutely, love this mouse	
484	pos	Love this mouse	
485	neg	As of writing right now my left click is not responding as effectively and it seems like online forums complain about the same thing	
485	neg	Do not buy this mouse if you want it to have an early expiration date	
486	neg	Then I realized that left clicks weren't registering consistently anymore	
486	pos	I loved everything about this mouse -- it feels incredibly natural and accurate	
487	pos	I like it, but some of the buttons are pressed too easily	
488	pos	Needless to say, i'm glad I did and the good reviews for this product are well-deserved	
488	pos	The mouse feels wonderful to hold	
488	pos	I'm glad the ability to change the weight was included as I have big hands and need an ample amount of weight for the mouse to feel great in my palm	
488	pos	Its because of this that the mouse has more functionality beyond just gaming	
488	pos	The ergonomic build is great as well	
488	pos	The quality of the entire mouse is just awesome	
488	pos	Everything from the material used to the lighting effects and the design itself is perfect	
488	pos	I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great mouse to game with, wither it's for the casual gamer or the PC gaming enthusiast	
489	neg	The media could not be loaded	
489	pos	Always loved how logitech felt in my hand	
489	pos	Loved the idea of weights, because I like a heavier feel	
489	pos	Plug and play and feels good	
490	pos	The adjustable weights give it a nice heft, the size fits well, especially in larger hands	
490	pos	All the buttons are great	
490	pos	It's honestly one of the best features	
490	pos	The scroll wheel is phenomenal	
492	pos	So, the mouse itself is pretty basic	
493	neg	Scroll wheel is raised and extremely sensitive, so you'll accidentally scroll on webpages or cycle inventory in games	
494	neg	The issue has become so bad that it is sometimes impossible for me to highlight text, drag icons around on my desktop, or play a character like Hanzo in Overwatch	
495	pos	This mouse has a good feel	
495	pos	I like the weight and the button placement	
496	pos	The mouse is actually pretty good	
496	pos	and at a very good price	
497	neg	After a few months of use, the mouse is having this double click issue that frequently affects me when I'm trying to play a game	
497	neg	It also makes it tough to drag windows across my screens since I have to try several times until I can click the window without it double clicking	
499	neg	As of late, I've started to notice that the left click will often double or triple click when only pressed once (probably an issue with the switch)	
499	neg	As one can imagine, typical tasks such as navigating Windows and playing games become a nightmare	
499	neg	Programs are accidentally double clicked and launched, and inputs are inconsistent	
499	pos	The mouse is super responsive, very ergonomic, and all the customizable buttons are fun to play with	
501	neg	Initially, this mouse was great, however, at the eleven-month mark, the mouse started getting the dreaded double-clicking issue that Logitech is known for	
501	neg	I will never buy another Logitech product again	
503	pos	You have a case of weights so that you can easily change the weight of the mouse to suit your preferences	
504	neg	G-Hub crashes constantly, and when it does the mouse does not retain its dpi settings making for an incredibly annoying user experience	
504	neg	The dpi adjust buttons are in a bad location that constantly get pressed accidentally so I had to disable them	
505	pos	I plugged it in right away and it worked great	
505	pos	The scroll whee has an awesome texture and it very smooth	
505	pos	And the scroll wheel DOES NOT break and spin freely	
505	pos	The sensor is absolutely amazing and the software is very intuitive	
505	pos	You can change the color of the G logo and the dpi lights as well as the function of the buttons	
505	pos	The ergonomics of it is amazing	
506	neg	It is either an inferior or faulty product	
506	neg	1/5 for ergonomics, it has a focus button right where my thumbs fingertip is, where i apply pressure to move the mouse	
506	neg	The mouse will freeze in place despite moving the mouse hiccuping every few seconds, making some gaming IMPOSSIBLE	
506	neg	1/5 quality of material	
506	neg	Cheep plastic, the included weights dont help	
506	neg	This is the worst mouse I have ever bought	
507	neg	Out of the box I've had nothing but left click issues with this mouse	
507	neg	Nearly every left click either hangs and creates a drag command or double clicks	
507	neg	This product fails completely at its primary job and it should be avoid completely until Logitech resolves the issues with their products	
508	neg	I think the cable has a short	
509	neg	I like the mouse overall but the left click is breaking	
509	neg	It will either double click, not register a click at all, or if your holding it down it stops registering	
509	neg	Very frustrating when you trying to play a game where you need to hold the button down or when you need to drag stuff	
509	neg	Nothing works	
509	neg	Mouse is pretty much broken after 2 months	
509	neg	The problem is intermittent  but makes this mouse the worst mouse i've ever used	
510	neg	The issue has become so pronounced now that the mouse is no longer usable and I am past the return period so I am unsure what to do with it	
511	pos	I use this at work and liked it so much that I bought one for home (light gaming, work)	
513	pos	Great mouse	
513	pos	Perfect value	
513	pos	Very satisfied with software	
513	pos	DPI settings are just the best	
513	pos	Customization is good	
513	pos	Value is amazing	
514	pos	It clicks, it moves, software has been good, never any issues	
514	pos	It fits my hand well, I prefer this style of mouse more than others	
514	pos	Great mouse	
514	pos	The wireless version of the G502, Lightspeed; although more expensive, is just as good	
516	neg	The left mouse button started sticking	
516	neg	The left button has gotten to the point where the mouse isn't really usable anymore	
516	neg	Cons: Makes you hate your life after 8 months and you slowly spiral downwards as this mouse continues its inconsistent breaking process over the course of around a year before you finally give up and have to buy a new mouse, the whole while wondering what is wrong with our horrible world	
516	pos	Pros: Feels good on your hand	
518	neg	I’m just a little disappointed Seeing that the buttons failed after a few clicks	
518	pos	I've been using it for a year now and this has been the best mouse I have ever owned	
518	pos	The fact that you can adjust the weight is a nice touch too	
519	pos	Comfortable in my hand	
519	pos	I've got large hands, and it really fits two styles of how I grip the mouse	
519	pos	Either way, the mouse feels great	
519	pos	The adjustable weights are a plus, and there is an incredible amount of customization with both the dpi and the inputs for the additional buttons	
519	pos	Makes productivity and gaming much more enjoyable	
519	pos	RGB is subtle and customizable as well	
519	pos	Overall I've really been satisfied with this and I'd totally recommend it for the price point, which for me was about $40	
523	pos	It works great, custom buttons, speed, etc	
523	pos	I'm really pleased with it	
524	pos	This is a great gaming mouse even just from plugging it in	
524	pos	Within seconds it was easy to understand how it works	
524	pos	Overall great mouse both in and out of games	
525	pos	The mouse was great for a while	
525	pos	Feels good in the hand, slides well, removable weights, enough extra buttons, nice design	
527	neg	The weights fit very tightly in both the mouse and the case, and they're kind of annoying to put in and take out	
527	neg	The RGB customization is not that great	
527	neg	And one issue that I think was just because mine was a bit faulty, the color of the RGB is off	
527	pos	Great response time, great customization for mouse functions, feels great in the hand, all around great	
527	pos	I love how it looks, I love it in almost every way, so just because the cons list is longer, doesn't mean its not an incredible mouse	
527	pos	This is an incredible product, I've tried other mice, and I would always go with the G502 series without hesitation, and they are by far the most comfortable mice I've ever held	
528	neg	It’s super annoying and unusable	
529	pos	It has excellent response time (I usually play snipers) and the DPI is customizable	
529	pos	It fits comfortably in my hand, which is much needed as I am usually at the PC for a good chunk of my day for work and gaming	
532	neg	It's very frustrating, and not something I've dealt with in Logitech mice before	
534	pos	It also has excellent tracking and works really well for every game I use it with	
534	pos	I honestly could care less about the lighting, but it is customizable and looks cool, I guess	
537	neg	The mouse has had lighting issues since day one but I like the mouse so I disabled that and have been enjoying it	
538	pos	This is a good mouse it feels nice and the programmable buttons are very nice to use for everyday work and also for gaming for buttons that are to reach on a keyboard when you are a gaming	
538	pos	The software is good also a lot of people complain about it but for me it isn't to bad	
539	neg	After seven full months of use, the left mouse button is double clicking and not holding when drag/drop is needed	
542	neg	It is very annoying dealing with this double clicking	
543	neg	Biggest problem is how stiff the scroll wheel button is to click, combined with having to avoid hitting the side-to-side button clicks on the scroll wheel - annoying	
543	neg	The other problem is with the radical undercut on the front of the mouse - when clicking and dragging I was causing the back of the mouse to lift up, then when I'd release it would drop down again which moved the mouse placement and the thing I was dragging would get "dropped" in the wrong place	
543	neg	I managed to train myself to use a lighter touch after a few days, but it was an annoying few days	
544	neg	After 2 weeks, the mouse started to become non responsive	
544	neg	The mouse itself would freeze	
545	pos	I have had mine for a year now and I can happily say this is the best mouse for gaming and computing that I have ever owned	
545	pos	The scroll lock still works like a clock	
546	neg	Only thing I noticed was the scroll wheel wobbles a bit side to side if you quickly move the mouse side to side in a wiggling motion	
546	pos	Probably the best wired gaming mouse out there	
546	pos	I use it solely with fingertip grip and it's perfect	
546	pos	Software is pretty good	
549	neg	There is a left click problem with this one	
549	neg	Sometimes it doesn't even work	
549	neg	Not consistent	
549	neg	So disappointed	
550	pos	Otherwise the mouse is great	
550	pos	It's comfortable in the hands	
550	pos	Adjustable weights are very nice and evenly distribute the weight based on where you put them	
550	pos	(I have small hands and usually use a heavier mouse) I'm happy the mouse had options on it	
551	neg	Also the scroll wheel button doesn't work because they added buttons on either side of it, which you have to lean to activate, so when you try to push the scroll wheel button down it will just fall to one side and push something you didn't want to	
551	neg	Which is still pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with GHUB before it stopped working, and now I can't use it at all	
552	pos	I put up with this mouse for over a year now because I really liked how it felt, but the error ratio has steadily increased to beyond occasional frustration	
553	neg	If you are over 6 feet, chances are you or hands will engulf this uncomfortably	
553	neg	My biggest grievance is the AWFUL MOUSE WHEEL	
553	neg	I don't know why reviews are mentioning this but it is unusable	
553	neg	It spins like crazy and can't be controlled	
553	neg	Always comes off and the rubber is already peeling	
554	neg	Total piece of junk	
554	neg	Save your time and money, look past the marketing and google this mouse's issues before wasting your hard earned money	
555	neg	However, it will grow worse over time	
557	neg	Slightly less ergonomic, has more buttons, too big for my tiny hands	
557	neg	Would buy again if it continues to function	
557	neg	Only a few months in and the RMB is now suffering from the apparently infamous double click problem	
557	neg	I got a replacement from Logitech fairly easily but the replacement has the same problem on two different buttons	
557	neg	It's pretty unfortunate and makes the product essentially unusable	
557	neg	Currently looking for another mouse, do not buy	
558	neg	It was a pain to figure out to simply save the setting's and not have to redo them after every boot	
559	pos	This product have a really nice design, I like the quality they used on it, this mouse have a lot of programmable buttons	
559	pos	That's something unique specifically for this mouse because there's not really a lot of mouses out there that can do that	
560	neg	I wasn't sure about the button placement but after a few minutes they make a lot of sense and i don't have to adjust my hand to hit any of them	
560	pos	Feels great, I wear a size L glove	
561	pos	Great mouse	
562	neg	The right click button feels as if it's worn out	
562	neg	It does not have a distinct down-click like the left click does	
565	pos	Wow, this mouse is really a great improvement	
565	pos	Feels great in my hand, very responsive, great for the games I play, many different buttons to click and program	
565	pos	I do recommend	
566	neg	CON: it's not greatly ergonomic, and i'm sure this isn't the best mouse, but as a start into the area of quality, it is good	
566	neg	if it breaks within a year, i'm giving it a 1 star	
566	pos	This is the first quality mouse, i've ever owned	
566	pos	PRO: joy to use	
567	neg	The mouse's middle button/wheel feels really weird, almost clunky and a bit noisy	
567	pos	The weights are ok	
568	neg	The only negative I have found is the RGB lights kind of stink but I didn’t buy it bc of the RGB, I bought it for every other reason	
568	pos	The placement of them is great	
568	pos	I also love how you can add weights	
568	pos	The braiding cable is very nice	
570	pos	This mouse is pretty cool	
570	pos	The mouse buttons are completely customizable and uses a Logitech application for easy customization	
570	pos	My favorite feature by far is the unlocking scroll wheel	
570	pos	This feature has really come in handy when scrolling in and out of projects for an easier view	
573	neg	I would recommend you not buy this one, or if you do once you notice the issue start to happen submit a warranty claim	
575	pos	The mouse is very good	
575	pos	It has good build quality, good sensor, and an excellent scroll wheel	
576	neg	The biggest problem is that the button that DOES have an issue is the most important one: The Left-Click button	
576	pos	The build quality seems good, the rubberized grips on the sides are nice, no issues with registration of movement, no issues of cable fraying and no issues with MOST of the buttons	
579	pos	This is a great gaming mouse	
580	pos	This mouse is honestly great	
580	pos	The feel of it, the looks, and the smoothness of it, I’m just glad this exists	
582	pos	I really like this one	
582	pos	I like the adjustable weights, I like a heavy mouse	
583	neg	However, it is absolutely awful	
583	neg	I can't even highlight text or use it in office applications, much less for games	
585	pos	What's important for me is the functional support that the buttons have since they're great for mmos and general desk work efficiency	
585	pos	The buttons are placed comfortably so you can reach them without difficulty, and you naturally form muscle memory on their location over time	
585	pos	I legit can't go back to regular mice because it's made work and gaming SO flippin easy and comfy	
585	pos	Wonderful product	
586	pos	It feels very sturdy unlike the supplied mouse I did away with	
587	pos	So far it works very well, and it fits wonderfully in my hand	
589	neg	The wheel button is just as bad	
589	pos	Slides good	
590	pos	Pros: for gaming, ergonomic, good quality, modifiable with the 5 included 3	
591	neg	The only con is my thumb can't reach the side button very well, but then again, I use a palm grip with half my palm on the desk	
591	pos	- I absolutely love the left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, which works even for going back/forward a page while browsing or fast forwarding/rewinding a video	
591	pos	- Easy to clean with no dead skin cell buildup on the rubber parts (just wipe it down every other week)	
592	pos	Looks and feels great	
592	pos	The scroll wheel was very smooth, but not quite as smooth as the MX Master	
592	pos	The button to slow dpi is also very useful and if not you can change it to whatever you need it to be	
593	pos	This mouse is really really awesome, it's pricey for a mouse but if you're a programmer, gamer or someone else who uses a computer for a long time it's WELL worth the price	
593	pos	I love the adjustable weighting, it's large and feels very well made	
593	pos	All the buttons are remappable, and the metal scroll wheel is just so much fun	
595	neg	Anyway right clicking eventually failed and you cannot hold it down	
597	pos	This mouse is amazing, basically it’s the only mouse you need when you want to improve your gaming skills	
599	pos	Extremely smooth on just about any surface	
599	pos	I like how easy it is to adjust the weights	
600	pos	Really happy with the design, feel, customization, and responsiveness of this product	
603	pos	The mouse works great	
603	pos	the easy to click dpi mode buttons are nice	
603	pos	PS:  I have tiny hands and can still reach all the buttons comfortably	
605	pos	Great mouse quality, incredible accurate, if heavy mouses arent for you dont even think about this	
606	neg	👎 "Sniper" button doesn't work whatsoever	
606	pos	Great build quality, feels so natural when your holding it	
607	neg	Broke right away, you can't even use the right mouse button	
608	pos	Looks really nice though	
609	pos	So far the functionality and feel of this mouse are amazing	
609	pos	I love everything about it	
611	pos	Excellent mouse, as advertised with no hardware issues	
612	pos	But I still love this mouse	
613	neg	I cant click and hold anything without it unselecting randomly	
616	neg	It is absolutely terrible in freewheel mode where it spins forever but even in the locked mode you can still feel it and it is still audible	
616	pos	Very ergonomic and the modular weight system is awesome	
618	pos	This mouse is great	
618	pos	Plenty of customization and hardware profiles can be loaded if you want to avoid software for things like RGB	
618	pos	Build quality is great, design is a little edgy but still doesn't scream 'gamer'	
620	neg	The scroll wheel is far too fast and even with all the weights in it still seems light and cheap	
621	neg	The resistance of the wheel is too large for me	
621	neg	It has some sort of tearing sound apart from the rolling sound when I use the wheel	
621	neg	Too many buttons are designed near the thumb and I did accidentally push these buttons when playing the game	
621	neg	The worst design in my mind is its antislip surface on two sides	
621	pos	The mouse itself works well and it is a good choice for everyday use and gaming	
621	pos	I love its shape and its breathing LED design, which makes it feel like a sense of technology	
621	pos	It is enjoyable to click the mouse	
622	pos	The adjustable scroll wheel option is such an amazing feature	
623	neg	The biggest issue for me is it feels noticeably smaller in my hand making more uncomfortable to use	
625	pos	Fantastic mouse	
625	pos	As a PC gamer with 16 yrs on steam, and many more before that, this mouse is great for me	
625	pos	Love it	
625	pos	New favorite	
626	neg	I ordered another one and the scroll wheel literally broke in the first hour of use	
628	pos	Solid construction, simple easy to use software	
629	pos	The mouse itself is good, lots of extra buttons, responsive, and weighted but all that is the good	
631	pos	This mouse works great	
632	pos	I have relatively small hands, and this mouse is a perfect fit for me	
632	pos	No wrist pain at all	
632	pos	The multiple buttons are really nice to have especially for gaming	
634	neg	Really annoying in every game	
634	neg	Stay away from this mouse	
635	neg	Very disappointed as this mouse felt great, and I loved the scroll wheel	
636	neg	After going through everything it still didn't fix the issue	
636	neg	Waste of $50	
637	neg	The 703 had the double click issue and fell apart within a year so I switched to the new model of the 502, it's still a sturdy great mouse and it's served me well	
638	neg	The USER Interface is difficult to use	
638	neg	The WORST MOUSE Logitech has made in 10 years	
638	neg	The mouse is TOO NARROW	
638	neg	I just lost a Game online because This meece DOES NOT use The Microsoft SETTINGS	
639	neg	I was disappointed with this mouse	
639	neg	The scroll wheel has two modes, free spin which is basically unusable for anything and the locked state which is too slow and makes a loud noise	
639	neg	The mouse click also requires very little pressure so I accidentally click with it	
640	neg	My only complaint is the slightly smaller overall footprint of the mouse	
640	pos	The very slidy teflon feet, which allow the G502 HERO to slide much faster than the G500s make the mouse seem faster and more responsive, even at the same DPI	
640	pos	The new sensor feels very snappy and precise and allows for very fine movements that the G500s wasn't as accurate at capturing	
641	neg	These switches fail very quickly and very often	
641	neg	I love using it, but it makes gaming and general productivity take a nose-dive when it struggles with the double-click/click-drag issue	
644	pos	It gets the job done, and at a pretty good price	
644	pos	It has weights that can be removed	
645	pos	I really like the ergonomics of this mouse and the features	
646	neg	Both have suffered from the same problem where the right mouse click starts double-tapping frequently	
646	neg	I wouldn't buy this again	
647	pos	I have no complaints and actually really like this mouse	
647	pos	The shape is nice and the feel is really there	
647	pos	I don't use the extra two programmable buttons placed up on the left click but it is still a great mouse	
648	pos	I enjoyed it very much	
650	pos	This is a good mouse for gaming	
650	pos	The on mouse adjustable dpi rate is very cool	
650	pos	You can click to switch from slow to fast mouse speed on the mouse	
650	pos	The left and right click switches are sensitive enough you can drag click with a little practice	
651	neg	mouse is built like junk so I can't recommend	
653	neg	3 times now because I am not gonna return it again, the main mouse buttons have become glitchy	
653	neg	Which being a gaming mouse is horrid	
653	neg	This is inexcusable	
653	pos	The sensor is great	
653	pos	The feel is great	
653	pos	The mouse overall is everything I want	
653	pos	So this is a great mouse	
654	pos	Something about the shape just feels good	
654	pos	Maybe it's the convenient thumb rest but, I love the way this mouse feels in my hand	
655	neg	However, this one really is just awful	
655	neg	It has this horrendous double click bug, where anytime you click on something, it thinks its a double click	
656	pos	The mouse fits in your hand like it was ment to fit in your hand	
656	pos	It has just the right amount of buttons	
656	pos	Very light mouse so there is weight included depending on how you like the feel of your mouse	
656	pos	The DPI button is nice to be able to shift through your profiles depending on what you are doing	
656	pos	I would definitely recommend this mouse especially for the price	
657	pos	Button placements are great and the scroll wheel locked/unlocked feel great though	
659	pos	The mouse is very comfortable in my hand and I love that the scroll wheel can be adjusted to click or scroll continuously	
659	pos	It has plenty of programmable buttons and feels like it is made of high quality materials	
660	neg	Cons:The current software program that controls everything sucks big ‘ol donkey donger	
660	pos	It’s a great gaming mouse	
660	pos	Pros:Feels great, it’s smooth, and clicks goods	
660	pos	Macro is neat and handy	
663	pos	great for gaming	
663	pos	not a bunch of buttons you gotta memorize and its rgb setting works perfect for my setup	
663	pos	on the fly dpi changing and reducing button	
664	neg	I would not recommend anyone buy this mouse	
664	neg	Save the money and buy something else	
664	pos	It’s a shame because the feel of the mouse is great	
665	neg	The media could not be loaded	
665	pos	I personally love the weights it comes with so you can fine tune the weight for your movements and adjust accordingly	
665	pos	Also the ability to fine tune the sensitivity of the mouse is awesome	
665	pos	You can make it super quick once you get your movements down and more accurate	
666	pos	The feel is excellent	
666	pos	Action is smooth ( I used the weights)	
666	pos	Anyway, im very satisfied by this mouse, and its price	
667	pos	This is my favorite gaming mouse	
668	neg	The ergonomics of this mouse is tall over wide, so if you want a flat mouse this isn't for you	
668	neg	Only problem was I couldn't hold the mouse because it was too small	
668	pos	The quality of material is exceptional, every part of it is good	
669	pos	I do like the placement of the buttons on the mouse, and setting up macros and functions is easy and quick	
669	pos	It also looks pretty darn cool	
670	pos	I love all the buttons and configurations I can set to them	
670	pos	I also that I can switch sensitivity on the fly with the DPI shortcuts	
671	pos	The sensor is very accurate and well worth the buy	
671	pos	Great mouse	
672	pos	So far after a month of use, this mouse has been really great	
672	pos	Logitech software is also easy to use to change the RBG and set profiles for DPI	
672	pos	Would highly recommend this mouse	
674	pos	Awesome mouse	
675	neg	This mouse I have for just over a year and it has double clicking, dragging issues	
676	neg	Scroll button loose	
677	pos	Best mouse you will ever buy	
677	pos	Great feel in your hand, programmable to just plug into any computer and have the programed button keys working as it should	
678	neg	Then I started having the clicking issue that multiple other people have mentioned in their reviews	
680	pos	I recommend this mouse for gaming	
681	neg	However, I have had troubles with the software, every time I restart my computer or update it and get on I'll click one of the buttons or move the cursor and realize it's at factory settings	
681	pos	The mouse is great, definitely a huge step up from what I was using before	
681	pos	The button that makes the DPI super slow is great for aiming especially in games like Fortnite where I use it the most	
684	pos	Very happy with this mouse	
685	pos	Outstanding product	
685	pos	The keys and software are great even for data entry tasks that are repetitive and involve multiple key presses	
685	pos	I’ve moved everything to the right hand	
686	neg	Only issue I had is I seem to be bumping or somehow changing my dpi accidentally all the time	
686	neg	But now I've got DOUBLE CLICKING	
687	pos	Love this mouse for gaming	
687	pos	I can make several different profiles for different games and change with a click	
687	pos	You can customize it in so many ways	
688	pos	I like the weight, I like the high DPI, and I love the feel	
689	neg	Outside of being used, the mouse wheel is the main reason I am returning this	
689	neg	The mouse wheel will rattle when the mouse is moved quickly, and is too easy to bump to the right and left, while difficult to press downward	
689	neg	The scrolling wasn't smooth either	
691	neg	Unfortunately, the left mouse button began to fail within months of use as if it were a no name piece of junk from Wish	
691	neg	Very dissatisfied and I will never buy Logitech again	
691	pos	Great mouse, has everything I need	
692	neg	DO NOT BUY	
694	neg	Now it's worse than before	
695	pos	really good fit for my hands, plenty of buttons and dpi up/down switch	
695	pos	Seems super responsive and versatile	
695	pos	On board profile switching and automatic game profiles too	
695	pos	Has weights you can add/take out to finetune your feel	
696	neg	The mouse also feel extremely cheap	
697	neg	Then the sensor started doing strange stuff	
699	neg	The mouse was great until the double click issue happened	
699	neg	Now this mouse is trash	
700	neg	However, this mouse is narrower than logitech's other offerings	
700	neg	It causes pain when using and the DPI shift buttons and back/forward buttons are constantly being accidentally triggered during gameplay	
700	pos	This is a nice mouse	
700	pos	It feels responsive	
700	pos	I like the tactile mouse wheel	
701	neg	However it is easy to press a button accidentally that lowers the dps setting so be on the lookout for that	
701	pos	Mouse is wonderful responsive and works great	
703	neg	I tried to like this mouse, but in the end, I really HATE it	
703	neg	So, I've had to disable the adjustable resolution entirely, just to make the mouse usable	
704	pos	Nothing to really complain about, it's a pretty good product, and its unlikely that something will beat it at its price range	
706	pos	I love this mouse	
706	pos	As for the price, it is outstanding in my opinion	
706	pos	The wheel is metal and just feels so great plus the two different modes for the wheel are awesome	
706	pos	It has great accuracy and the clicks feel great	
706	pos	It is adjustable as far as weight goes	
706	pos	The wire will just be internal so it works for me	
706	pos	I would definitely buy this again	
707	neg	However, the buttons are loose and feel cheap	
707	pos	The mouse functions well	
708	pos	I wanted to really like this mouse because of all the numerous enchancements but	
710	pos	This mouse has proven it's self time and time again, I recommend it to everyone I know	
711	neg	This mouse is heavy	
712	pos	The weight of the mouse is perfect, the buttons are in the perfect places, and it just feels good in your hand	
712	pos	Very high dpi and accuracy of movement making it perfect for pro gamers as well	
712	pos	Highly recommend this mouse	
713	pos	I like the logtech mice	
713	pos	This works really well in Ghub sub software, make sure to install that to run this mouse to full potential	
714	neg	This is extremely frustrating when you are dragging and dropping as it registers the LMB down up down up down up etc	
715	pos	This mouse has great quality material and works amazing	
715	pos	Even the small weights that you can add at the bottom are amazing	
715	pos	I’ve used this mouse for both mmo gaming and first person shooter gaming and highly recommend for anyone looking for a not super expensive, super high quality gaming mouse	
716	pos	I'm quite happy with this mouse for use in gaming and with my work	
716	pos	The options available to customize it for individual needs are very helpful	
717	pos	It's very nicely packaged	
717	pos	I love the little weights you can add to the mouse, and the scroll wheel has two modes, a fast, smooth one and a slower, more precise one where you get some haptic feedback with each scroll, very useful for gaming	
717	pos	The accent lights are changeable, very nice feel overall	
718	neg	TL;DR: Mouse breaks quickly	
718	pos	The button locations and customizability were nice	
719	neg	Wheel is not as grippy as it should be	
719	neg	Also, when you move the scroll wheel, the detents are too aggressive and you "miss" as in your finger slips off	
721	neg	However, my mouse started having the double click issue which is issue that caused me to swap from Razer to Logitech	
721	neg	Would not recommend at this time myself	
721	pos	When the mouse works, I like the mouse	
721	pos	Plenty of buttons to operator and responsive enough for me and feels pretty nice	
722	neg	Complete waste of a mouse and waste of my time	
723	neg	The back of it drops off too fast, and its too shallow for large hands (8 inches from the base to the tip of the middle finger)	
723	pos	Otherwise, everything else about this mouse is perfect and definitely lives up to the marketing material	
724	pos	Good work Logitech, you've made the best gaming mouse ever	
725	pos	Full of features and great build quality	
725	pos	Excellent for everyday use and does well for gaming	
727	pos	The dimensions make this mouse great for large and wide hands, while still being dynamic enough to comfortably detach from the palm for finer movements	
727	pos	The thumb shield on the side is generous, and seems like it can support even the largest of thumbs	
727	pos	The unlockable scroll wheel is super fun	
729	pos	It's seriously great	
729	pos	It's also nice that it comes with adjustable weights and rgb and all that	
731	neg	the one negative, FOR ME, is it's kinda small	
731	pos	Great mouse, i love the fluid controls and how everything is right where i need it	
731	pos	The software provides excellent customization capabilities	
731	pos	I really like that i can customize all led zones	
731	pos	the DPI shift button is an amazing feature	
731	pos	great product	
732	pos	honestly the best mouse i've ever owned	
732	pos	the weights are nice to have, and the software was really easy to install and get set up for the color changing	
733	pos	I use this mouse for mainly for gaming, but this mouse is perfect for everyday use, I love this mouse cause of how versatile it is

736	pos	There are nicely placed side buttons	
736	pos	You can toggle the scroll wheel to spin freely with the use of a toggleable button	
737	neg	Most recently, the right click has began to fail	
738	neg	I have finally had it with Logitech's quality issues	
739	pos	Excellent feel in my hand	
739	pos	Buttons are responsive and have a quiet but audible click	
739	pos	The whole mouse feels well built and the cable is flexible and durable	
740	neg	Buttons are easy to reach, but far enough apart that you don't accidentally misclick something	
740	pos	Very ergonomic	
741	pos	The mouse works well	
741	pos	It is comfortable, adjustable, has weights to make it easier to use	
743	neg	The only thing that's pointless is the front of the mouse , you can't see it ever, so don't let that weird spiky front scare you away its all good, buy this now	
743	pos	Honestly, this is a great mouse	
743	pos	I love the fact you can on the fly adjust your scrolling speed with a press of a button and let that middle wheel fly	
744	neg	This mouse is not suitable for any serious gamer	
744	pos	On the plus side, it is a well built unit and perfectly suitable for everyday use	
745	neg	In game to shot I had to remap, it was just horrible	
748	pos	The shape of the mouse is good, the braded cable is very nice and the weight system is very good	
749	neg	The left mouse button keeps messing up	
749	neg	It either won't register a click, clicks twice, or releases when you're still holding down on the button	
751	neg	Right at 6 months; I have double clicking issues that are getting worse every day (impossible to use)	
752	pos	Great build quality and a nice weight to it	
753	neg	The only downside of this mouse is the broken scroll wheel	
753	neg	Once you wear it out, it will break loose and will not function correctly	
753	neg	The sensor doesn’t deserve such low quality plastic	
753	pos	The sensor is amazing	
753	pos	Just wish the material was more durable and higher quality	
753	pos	This mouse is the best	
754	neg	Don't buy	
755	neg	This mouse has been great no real issues till now, now i get double click	
757	pos	And an optional break on the wheel is cool	
757	pos	Release the break and that wheel is well balanced and great for scrolling	
757	pos	Great product	
758	pos	Very responsive mouse with nice grip	
758	pos	The extra buttons on the left click have become a necessity for me	
759	neg	The mouse has started double clicking when I click once	
759	neg	This is a big issue when I try to highlight things or play any of my games	
760	neg	So it's a really good mouse but, unfortunately, the insides are made of cheap material	
760	neg	Notably, the mouse contacts/switches are really bad	
761	neg	My old mouse started having an issue with the middle mouse wheel button not working anymore when pressed	
762	pos	The mouse works very well	
762	pos	I really enjoy the added weights to the back of the mouse	
762	pos	App works, buttons work, good feel	
763	pos	I loved the ability to lock the scroll wheel (or let it spin freely)	
765	neg	Left click fails to drag randomly

766	pos	You can also customize the button functions	
766	pos	Ever since I got this I fell in love with the fact that you can adjust the weight	
1089	pos	It is definitely more precise and feels better to use than the low cost brands	
1090	neg	anyways, no logi products for me anymore	
1090	neg	I like my old G5, but I guess logi does not make solid products anymore	
1091	neg	There were no weights in the plastic bag it came in, and the gliders already had crud in them	
1091	pos	mouse feels awesome in the hand, it was obviously used when it was shipped to me	
1091	pos	The mouse though is fantastic, works well with the rest of my Logitech equipment	
1092	pos	Good mouse with programable buttons

1095	pos	5 stars	
1096	neg	They are totally useless	
1096	neg	Even the software doesn't have an option to remap these 3 useless buttons	
1096	neg	Total disappointment	
1096	neg	It's sitting in my cupboard now along with other useless products	
1097	pos	I have had it for a few months and it is holding up so far	
1097	pos	It is pretty responsive	
1098	neg	Like others have said before: whilst the mouse may be comfortable and works for a couple of months, I noticed while playing online matches that holding down the left click would no longer work	
1098	neg	Any game that relied on me needing to hold it down only ended in frustration and apparently this is a known issue with an internal component	
1098	neg	You can click regularly but anything longer than a second is pointless	
1099	pos	Plugged it in & it just worked	
1099	pos	The logitech software makes it super easy to customize the buttons, and the extra weights are perfect	
1099	pos	Also the dual mode scroll wheel wasn't something I knew I needed, but now I love it	
1100	neg	Ordered a new logitech mouse, received a used one	
1101	pos	All I can say is that I love it	
1101	pos	Logitech G-hub allows for nearly full customization of all mouse features	
1101	pos	Colors can be customized as well	
1102	neg	The second mouse I received worked for a day, then the scroll wheel had the same issue	
1102	neg	The exchange service was extremely fast but unfortunately the product just isn't going to work	
1102	neg	Gonna have to find another mouse

1104	pos	definitely  helpful	
1104	pos	Best mouse I've had in a long time

1106	pos	I'm a big dude, and my hands fit comfortably around this mouse	
1107	pos	High accuracy and love the customs option for all the buttons	
1108	neg	This is very frustrating	
1108	neg	I would expect better from a mouse at this price	
1108	neg	I'm not going to purchase any logitech products in the future, nor would I recommend them to anyone else	
1109	neg	But after a year of heavy use, the left click has stopped working	
1109	neg	Their quality has declined	
1109	neg	Do NOT get this mouse if you want something that lasts	
1110	neg	this is honestly sad because this mouse is near perfect the only other problem I've is the weird button layout  I'm always accidentally pressing buttons when I don't intend to	
1110	neg	But to its credit I did have this mouse for a year and a half before it broke still disappointing for a 60$ mouse though	
1111	pos	The mouse has a great feel, better than the wireless IMO (which I broke) This mouse is also  more durable to abuse	
1112	neg	The double click issue is insane and I've been trying to fix it for a year	
1113	pos	A few months out and enjoying this mouse being able to adjust the weight is a plus	
1113	pos	I like the feel of the mouse it was a great upgrade from my G302	
1114	pos	The fit and feel on the hand is top notch	
1114	pos	You can program all buttons to whatever you want	
1114	pos	The sniper button is cool on first person shooters in certain games	
1114	pos	The tracking sensor is the best I have ever felt with it’s accuracy	
1114	pos	I use it on PS4 and it’s awesome	
1115	pos	Love this mouse for gaming	
1115	pos	I love it so far	
1116	pos	Easily the best value gaming mouse on the market	
1116	pos	The cord is a nice lightweight material	
1117	neg	Really 100% scam and they know it mouse breaks after a few months starts to double and miss click and feet wear out no matter what after a year they don’t make replacements they need to be sued like Microsoft for stick drift they know of the clicking issue I have owned 6 mice now last one I’m buying	
1118	pos	I love this mouse it's the only one I use	
1118	pos	They are durable and the colors are nice	
1119	neg	So disappointed	
1120	neg	Left click will release at random and will double click at random only after six months of use was not worth the money	
1121	pos	Definitely a comfortable mouse	
1121	pos	I am a YouTuber and have been using it for a couple days now, and it has been great so far	
1121	pos	Will update if there are any issues but other than that, this mouse is smooth and won’t slide at all on your desk, which my last one did, the weighting stuff comes In a nice packed case so you can change them whenever, and I love the minimal but noticeable RGB, can’t wait until my Blackwidow keyboard comes so I can match it with this mouse	
1121	pos	It really is top of the line	
1122	pos	Great mouse, good weight that you can adjust with the included additional weights	
1122	pos	I have one weight in it and it feels great	
1123	pos	They fit perfectly in larger hands, are very quick to respond and customize	
1123	pos	I also like that they have weight - most other mice are too light and therefore harder to control	
1123	pos	Highly recommended	
1124	pos	This logitech is comfortable,  feels great and the software is easy to use and I haven't had any problems	
1125	neg	Loved this mouse until the left clicking completely failed, ~9 months into ownership	
1125	neg	Don't buy this mouse, don't buy it on this website	
1126	pos	Accurate and has a nice weight to it	
1126	pos	I myself like heavier mice, so the option to add weights to it is a big yes	
1127	neg	Be aware that if you buy this mouse, it has a very high chance of developing a known double clicking issue	
1128	neg	It doesn't give you a clear indication of your clicks which I feels is absolutely necessary in a good mouse	
1129	neg	Double click problem started a few weeks ago	
1129	pos	Absolutely fantastic mouse for 7 months	
1130	neg	Unfortunately it forced my hand into an awkward position mainly because of the button where the thumb should rest	
1130	neg	Too uncomfortable	
1130	pos	Versatile, looks really cool and lots of buttons	
1131	pos	There are no cons in all the product i've used on logitech product which is really good	
1131	pos	Its really good with extra 3 buttons on the left	
1132	pos	Great in all the ways advertised	
1133	neg	The mouse wheel is one of the biggest issues i had with this mouse	
1133	neg	It got extremely flimsy as time went on and when doing flick shots i can feel the mouse wheel smack the sides when moving the mouse in rapid successions	
1134	neg	not worth it unless u set them up at tournaments or something where they have no use to the wheel	
1134	pos	This was the best mouse 4 friends and I could've asked for	
1135	pos	Solid mouse, I was worried about it being 'heavy' but its perfect for me tbh	
1135	pos	I love the dpi lock button aka the sniper button, really clutch in games	
1135	pos	Feels pretty ergonomic and I haven't had a problem with it so far	
1136	pos	Good quality mouse however the price is lower in stores	
1137	neg	I've always loved Logitech products but this mouse has problems that make it unusable	
1137	neg	Accurate drag and drop is near impossible	
1138	pos	I can't say anything bad about this mouse	
1138	pos	I got it for my 11yo son's birthday, and he loves it	
1138	pos	I programmed some of the buttons for him, and am perfectly ecstatic by his love of this mouse	
1138	pos	Definitely recommend	
1139	pos	I really like the tilt wheel, good for strafing etc	
1139	pos	So many more buttons available and looks awesome	
1140	pos	I love this mouse	
1140	pos	Super sensitive and the programmable buttons are awesome as well as the extra weights it comes with	
1142	pos	it actually looks very clean, especially in a low light settings, and the dpi adjustment on the mouse itself is very useful for gaming and web browsing	
1142	pos	the rgb screen sampler is also a super cool feature that i wish my keyboard had as well	
1142	pos	in conclusion, i am very satisfied with this purchase, and I’ll update this review depending on the state of the mouse	
1143	pos	This is amazing, I've never had a more comfortable mouse to hold and utilize for 8+ hours on end	
1145	neg	Only complaint is the wheel is way too sensitive	
1147	pos	The buttons all seem to be in the perfect spot	
1147	pos	Even if you don’t need or want the extra buttons this build and hero sensor is just perfect	
1147	pos	10/10 recommend	
1148	neg	Would sometimes behave strangely and could not control the mouse	
1149	neg	Not even 2 months into having the mouse I started to have issues with the right click button	
1151	pos	Good mouse, very useful programmable buttons	
1151	pos	The insert able weights are a nice feature	
1152	pos	Best gaming mouse everThis is the third G502 I owned	
1152	pos	G502 is stable and fast respondsRecommend to all gamers	
1154	neg	It's a great mouse but it suffers from a double click issue	
1154	neg	This is my 2nd G502 Hero mouse, both this one and my first suffered from issues within 6 months of purchase	
1155	neg	However, I began to encounter drift issues and the mouse randomly not working unless I unplug and replug the USB	
1155	pos	The mouse was fantastic for me during the first 3 months, with great features and a solid weight	
1156	pos	That aside, though, it's a great mouse that's great for gaming	
1156	pos	It feels comfortable on my hand and it's very responsive	
1157	pos	Fits nice in your hand, glides ever so smoothly over the surface	
1157	pos	Love the interchangeable weights that come with it	
1158	neg	Both my mice have failed on me in less than a year	
1158	neg	They both got the double clicking issue that slowly gets worse until your mouse breaks	
1159	pos	Overall the build quality is very solid and extremely comfortable in the hand	
1159	pos	Overall a very well built mouse for the money	
1160	neg	Felt great, adjustable weights, etc	
1160	neg	Very disappointed for a mouse of this caliber	
1161	pos	Would definitely recommend	
1163	pos	It has a great feel, is fairly light and the software was easy to use	
1164	neg	My main issue is just the fact that the switch isn't well made and breaks in mere months	
1165	pos	Got this for my boyfriend for the holidays and he said he loves it so much more than is older mouse	
1165	pos	If you’re looking for a gaming mouse, this is the one	
1166	neg	When the same right mouse button issue showed up on the second mouse I purchased @ 4 months in, I moved on to another brand	
1167	pos	The response time is amazing and the ability to change your DPI on the fly is very useful for me	
1168	pos	So far it is a good mouse	
1169	neg	Out of the blue, starting today, the mouse will randomly perform a right-click	
1170	pos	I bought this for my son and he loves it

1170	pos	the 11 programmable buttons are great for gaming	
1170	pos	the mouse is built very well	
1170	pos	I would suggest buying this mouse whenever it is on sale if you are looking for a gaming mouse

1171	pos	The adjustable weight alone makes it worth buying	
1172	pos	Very comfortable, lots of buttons and is accurate

1188	pos	My son loves this mouse more than any previous Mouse he has used for his gaming	
1189	pos	I like gaming mousses, and this is by far my favorite	
1189	pos	It has such a sleek design, it's durable, it's ergonomic and it's button clicks are great	
1189	pos	But by far, the best feature is the scroll wheel	
1191	pos	The mouse is very solid and the weight of it is great	
1191	pos	I’ve been using the G305 mouse for awhile and it’s a good mouse but I have a tendency to pick it up accidentally while playing a game because of its light weight and I wanted a mouse that weighed more and this is the perfect mouse for it	
1191	pos	The G502’s quality is excellent and it feels great in my hand	
1192	pos	The grip feels good, the button responses are good, and the customization is a sick bonus like omg

1200	neg	There quality has gone down in recent years	
1202	pos	The mouse is good	
1202	pos	The added weights are a great thing and I really want these type of weights to be added to many more mice	
1203	neg	Can't even use the mouse at all now, every time I try doing something the mouse causes my browser to go back a page, and sometimes it will just make it impossible to do anything at times	
1203	neg	Probably just got unlucky, but i'm still rather disappointed that it stopped working within a month	
1204	neg	The G502 isn't as comfortable/ergonomic as the Intellimouse, and the scroll wheel is noisy	
1204	neg	It clicks constantly while scrolling, which is driving me nuts	
1207	pos	It’s a great mouse I recommend it 100% awesome features in the software	
1209	pos	Unlimited profiles and keys, highly recommend for productive or gaming activities	
1210	neg	It is so bad when you hold right click it disengages multiple times without letting go of the button (makes it impossible to play fps, even had a heck of a time in warcraft spinning the camera) I had the g500 for years and thought this would be the new great mouse I could have for a while	
1211	pos	The adjustable resolution of the mouse is great, as are the weights and lighting effects	
1212	pos	Quality materials and great sensitivity tho	
1212	pos	It also looks pretty badass, so that's also a plus	
1213	neg	Only issue the right n left click are the first things to start messing up	
1213	pos	Awesome mouse	
1214	neg	The G502 was a huge disappointment, from the get-go, the middle mouse button rattled when moving side to side, in both locked and unlocked position	
1216	pos	Great feel and seems to be good quality	
1218	pos	He likes it a lot & works great	
1220	pos	and i mean RGBbro this scroll wheel is the best ive ever used so far

1222	pos	Overall, really great mouse	
1223	neg	If you do a lot of fps gaming where you aim down sights then shoot don't get this mouse	
1224	pos	Had this mouse over a year and still loving it

1229	pos	Works great	
1231	neg	My mouse was working great until the scroll wheel wont pick up scrolling anymore the mouse grip is very uncomfortable if you have bigger hands the scroll wheel on this mouse is just absolutely garbage there's no grip to it and it just slips from your fingers when gaming	
1232	pos	Great for gaming can adjust weight and sensitivity easily the wire is long enough for my setup and love the feel of it	
1233	pos	Use this primarily for gaming, love the unlocking scroll wheel, as well as the adjustable weight	
1234	pos	love the mouse works awesome playing cold war and wooping butt	
1235	pos	I like the extra added weight that comes with the mouse	
1237	neg	After even mild use, the right mouse button starts to not respond, or respond only randomly	
1238	pos	It’s been a pretty good mouse	
1240	neg	Just dead after turning on my PC one day	
1240	neg	I know hardware can go out sometimes but a mouse shouldn't have a problem like this	
1242	neg	It's now September 19th and my g502 hero is already experiencing double click issues with the left click button, which makes most games nigh unplayable	
1243	pos	I like the macro key customization for any of the buttons on it	
1243	pos	It's comfortable I like the whieghts you can add to it I like using all of them good heavy mouse so I can do fine detail things in games and such really a all around good gaming mouse	
1244	pos	I had a regular G502 when it was released and loved it	
1244	pos	I ended up giving that away and bought the G502 hero and I absolutely love it	
1246	pos	Love it been using for years bought a second to have on hand	
1247	neg	The only complain i have is that I accidentally fat finger the mouse speed buttons	
1247	pos	Overall it’s a great mouse and is the definition of customizable	
1248	neg	My only issue is the bright LED lights logitec put on it	
1248	pos	Good mouse overall	
1249	neg	Hate the shipping negligence of putting a shipping sticker on the product packaging and mailing it as-is	
1249	pos	Love this mouse, bought as a backup to the same model	
1250	neg	This wheel is made of hard plastic that is too slick and I am continually wetting my finger trying to get traction	
1250	neg	But - the wheel thing is too annoying	
1252	pos	I loved this product	
1252	pos	I love the programmable 11 buttons	
1252	pos	It’s very useful	
1252	pos	I love the adjustable weights, but personally so keep all weights in my mouse for the heaviest/most weighted	
1252	pos	I just wanna share this with them, because this mouse is the best	
1254	neg	Bought in March and now does not work, reinstalling drivers didn't work	
1254	neg	Mouse randomly doubleclicks or fails to hold a click	
1255	neg	The mouse is fantastic for the first handful of months, but after that the cheap switches they use causes clicking problems and ruin the whole experience	
1255	neg	Left-clicking and dragging becomes nearly impossible and constant double clicking occur	
1255	neg	I've used 3 different G502 mouses and each one has had this problem occur, while the hundreds of other complaints I've read online repeating the same problem	
1255	neg	I personally would not suggest this mouse if you desire to have a good mouse that will work for more then 5 months	
1256	pos	It works very well and fits right in my hand	
1256	pos	It also has very useful features in its software	
1256	pos	I highly recommend it	
1257	neg	I do not like the middle mouse scroll wheel	
1258	pos	I love this	
1258	pos	Custom button mapping is also a plus	
1262	pos	This mouse is great I love it	
1262	pos	The program is extremely easy to use and you can program any button to do almost anything	
1262	pos	The scroll wheel is nice and I love how there is a button each way you push the scroll wheel (left or right)	
1262	pos	10/10 rating I would recommend	
1262	pos	Best customizable mouse you can find	
1268	neg	It only last 4 months before start failing the right button, it got double click then, at 8 month it start double clicking on the left button, now 14 months after buy, it just lost the lefth click	
1269	pos	My absolute favorite mouse, and the software actually worked for this one (unlike the last	
1270	pos	Nice corded mouse for gaming and everyday use	
1272	neg	Four months after purchase and the left click has stopped working completely	
1273	pos	Does great, I had the original g502 and it worked great so I thought I'd get this one with the new sensor	
1273	pos	The sensor on this does amazing at picking up fast movements and making sure it gets transmitted into the game	
1273	pos	I am very happy with this purchase	
1274	neg	Bought a G502 Hero for me and my wife, both developed double clicking issues on the left and right mouse buttons after only a month	
1275	pos	I loved it so much that I've been gifting this to all my friends	
1275	pos	I like the way my hand sits on the mouse	
1276	neg	Actual trash, low quality product	
1276	neg	This has to be the worst, stopped working after 6 months	
1276	neg	I have had it for 5 years and counting, but this HERO mouse is garbage	
1277	pos	It’s awesome	
1278	neg	After about a week of use though I started to notice how extremely sensitive and loose the scroll wheel was, which for me wasn’t good for the way I rest my finger on the scroll wheel	
1279	pos	The mouse is perfect	
1279	pos	I’ve been using it for a little while now and it hasn’t been a disappointment, as it functions perfectly and it feels exceptional to hold	
1279	pos	Overall an incredible mouse, great build quality, performance, and looks	
1280	pos	I enjoy being able to change the weight of the mouse depending on what I'm doing	
1281	pos	Excellent value for the money	
1281	pos	Has a lot of great features & is easy to setup using the Logitech software suite	
1282	pos	the build quality is amazing, fully customisable mouse buttons, the option to make mouse setting “profiles”, and even changing the weight of the mouse and comfortable feel on your hands is amazing	
1282	pos	100% would recommend, amazing bang for your buck	
1283	neg	I bought 2 of these mice and I use them for competitive fortnite after I had them for a bout 4 months it started doing wired stuff like turning off for no reason then my scroll wheel started locking up and would get stuck and then one of them just wouldn’t work out of nowhere now just today my one that is left I’ve had it for a bout 6 months now it’s now double clicking and this mouse is also really heavy my wrist herts all the time cause of how heavy it is	
1284	pos	With the logitech programn it makes it easy to set this mouse up and the price is perfect this is my second  1st one lasted years	
1286	neg	Got this mouse in February 2019, now it is early August and it is almost unusable due to double clicking issue	
1287	neg	The only dislike i have with this particular gaming mouse is that the scroll wheel is really lose	
1287	neg	Scrolling once will actually scroll multiple times & that can get kinda annoying	
1287	pos	I’ve played Fortnite, Cold War , modern warfare, Roblox & Rage 2… This mouse preformed well	
1288	pos	I love my mouse; since I was used to get mouses for about $10 - $15, this is the most expensive I've ever bought	
1289	neg	Had the mouse just over a year and both left and right mouse buttons started spam clicking it started with the right mouse switch and then the left switch started actin up	
1290	pos	The extra buttons are very useful, it has the perfect size for my hand, lot's of costumization, very precise but it is heavy	
1291	neg	The only problem I have with it is when you move your mouse the middle mouse key jiggles around which causes the mouse to shake accompanied by an annoying rattling sound	
1291	pos	The G502 Hero is a nice and responsive mouse with nice features and customizing	
1292	pos	Everything is reachable and comfortable for small hands	
1293	pos	Best mouse yet for gaming	
1293	pos	Would recommend to anyone	
1295	pos	And I must say I'm glad I chose this	
1295	pos	Feels good in my right hand	
1296	pos	He's been using it for a few months now, and is very pleased with the product	
1297	pos	Love the weight and feel of this mouse	
1297	pos	Matches my Logitech G810 keyboard perfectly	
1297	pos	Would definitely recommend and buy again	
1298	pos	hero sensor has grade A tracking, ergonomic shape is great for fingertip grip	
1299	pos	It's a great mouse	
1299	pos	Smooth, accurate, lots of programmable buttons (which as a lite gamer I will probably never use, but my bird very much appreciates their clicky noises)	
1299	pos	Also, as someone with a smaller hand, it fits very comfortably	
1300	pos	This mouse is hands down the best mouse I have ever had in my life	
1300	pos	The rgb is the smoothest and satisfying thing I’ve seen in a gaming product	
1300	pos	The buttons feel like they have been worked hard on and the feel of the product in total is outstanding	
1300	pos	I definitely would recommend this product	
1302	neg	I liked the idea of having extra buttons next to my left click	
1302	neg	This mouse is extremely heavy (without weights)	
1304	neg	but had trouble where you have to click the DPS button in order for a right click to register	
1306	neg	The wheel is so sensitive it will move when moving the mouse too quick or if you pick it up and put it back down	
1306	neg	It's so terrible	
1313	neg	Not very comfortable after a half hour of gaming	
1314	neg	Dont waste time with this mouse	
1317	neg	Do not buy this mouse, this is the third one I have gotten, I replaced 2 for the exact same issue	
1325	neg	I bought this twice and again I have problem - this time around scroll tilt function (left and right) - such that it just doesn’t tilt like my G600	
1325	neg	So disappointing	
1328	neg	The dpi buttons are in the wrong place ,very bad design  ,this is not a gaming mouse by far , unless you want your mouse moving at Mach 10 across your screen , quality is good  nice feel , and there is no way to disable the dpi buttons	
1331	neg	But they have almost no durability- my last mouse had a double clicking issue within a year, and now this one is either double clicking the right mouse button or doesn't let me hold the button down	
1335	neg	The right button stopped responding after only a week of use	
1337	neg	Logitech warranty support not efficient, pretty long and annoying procedure	
1345	neg	I bought this seeing a ton of good reviews but when I got it I was extremely disappointed	
1345	neg	0/10 would not recommend	
1347	neg	After only a couple months of using the mouse, the scroll wheel broke and does not allow me to click down with it	
1347	neg	Scrolling is good, but I am unhappy with the clicking not working	
1353	neg	I've had this mouse for less than a year and the left mouse button will send double clicks on its own	
1353	neg	At first I thought it was just me not clicking correctly but it's gotten progressively worse over the past few months that the mouse is almost unusable	
1356	neg	This mouse cost too much for a 8 month life span	
1356	neg	The left click is now useless with zero accuracy	
1359	neg	I never leave reviews on Amazon, but this mouse deserves a horrible one	
1359	neg	It started the random double clicking after only using it for 8 months	
1361	neg	About 6 months in and I'm starting to notice that the left mouse button will double-click which is really inconvenient in games	
1361	neg	It also has issues now with dragging a window	
1363	neg	Scroll wheel stopped working after a month and 1 day	
1364	neg	The mouse's right-click doesn't work any longer after less than one year of ownership	
1366	neg	The software to program the buttons doesn’t work unless you have the game you want to play installed on the computer you are using to configure the mouse	
1369	neg	I had been using this mouse for almost 2 years, but a couple of months ago it started to double click randomly, there is no real easy fix to this problem and it was very annoying	
1374	neg	Expect the switches that drive the left and right buttons to fail after a year	
1374	neg	Left click is super squishy	
1380	neg	But after only just 2 months of using the mouse the left click started to not work it would double click when i didn't mean to or stutter when i held down left click i don't usually write reviews but this has been a repeated issue with the G502 mice and it's really annoying to have to buy new mice over and over again	
1381	neg	Mouse started double clicking after 9 months	
1386	neg	There is only one thing bad about this mouse: the scroll wheel	
1394	neg	Holding the right mouse button would continuously register new clicks, so trying to pan the camera in games would create stutters and general lack of responsiveness	
1395	neg	Two of them arrived with broken scrolling wheel and 3rd broke after two weeks	
1397	neg	The only downside is that this thing is VERY sensitive	
1400	neg	The cover piece that cover the Mouse Eye/Weight area look so bad and scratches	
1401	neg	A little over a month using it and the double click/not holding the click issue came up like many people have stated in the review section	
1401	neg	Its not worth the money for such a basic design flaw (as many have had the same exact issue)	
1402	neg	The left click button has an intermittent issue that will cause this mouse to fail	
1409	neg	Received this product and all but one light on the side doesn't work	
1409	neg	Very disappointed, the lighting was a big part of why I chose this mouse over others similar	
1410	neg	Right mouse button starts releasing itself when held down	
1410	neg	Cleaning with wipes and compressed air cannot fix	
1410	neg	Suspect cheap design for right mouse button	
1415	neg	Worked for about a month then broke	
1415	neg	My $14 trash mouse has lasted a year and works better than this	
1421	neg	Mouse can't click and hold long enough to drag stuff around	
1423	neg	This mouse is infamous for misclicks	
1423	neg	Just terrible	
1423	neg	Do not waste your money	
1424	neg	But both the right and left mouse buttons are not working correctly anymore	
1424	neg	Holding either one down is unreliable, I can not even drag windows across my screen	
1426	neg	after falling off the desk the middle button started randomly clicking when scrolling and scrolling would skip lines or not work	
1434	neg	I have been using this mouse for like 2-3 months now and it been hurting my wrists playing with it	
1441	neg	It was a great mouse up until the laser stopped working right	
1441	neg	Really disappointing	
1443	neg	The switch in the right mouse button is faulty	
1444	neg	The mouse started to double click and now it's gotten worse	
1444	neg	Super annoying to try to play FPS games with it	
1445	neg	The only complaint is how heavy it is compared to other options out there	
1446	neg	Not a fan of buying “gamer” products, but this was was just plain broken because of the over engineering that went into the mouse wheel (MB3)	
1447	neg	After 6 months of use, the mouse is double clicking	
1447	neg	I'm really disappointed in the quality of the mouse	
1448	neg	The only problem I can think of is that LGHUB is not the easiest thing to use and was very outputting for me at first	
1460	neg	Was way smaller then my previous mouse	
1461	neg	Wheel is loose and useless	
1462	neg	Left-Click broke within 30 days of owning it	
1462	neg	It double-clicks when i single-click, and can no longer hold down left-click	
1471	neg	Garbage	
1474	neg	This mouse is trash for the price	
1474	neg	Mouse clicks don’t register around 1/10 the time and is pretty flimsy	
1474	neg	Pretty disappointed for a $50 mouse	
1477	neg	Two months into the purchase and the mouse started having issues with its left click button to where I can't drag and drop stuff	
1480	neg	So after about a year the double click issue popped up	
1488	neg	Do not buy it	
1490	neg	This thing barely made it three months before dying so hard my PC wouldn't boot with it plugged in	
1490	neg	Support took 3 days to reply to my email with a form letter asking them to email back with the same details from my original email	
1492	neg	EDIT: changing my review to 1 star because this mouse broke after 8 months of consistent use (started randomly clicking)	
1493	neg	Couldn't get it to work with any of my games	
1496	neg	Great mouse in theory but I've been through 3 of them now and every time the click buttons break	
1496	neg	they definitely did not make these to last longer than 1 year	
1502	neg	The only problem is that in about 1 year the mouses left button will become an issue	
1502	neg	Sometimes it will not respond when you use it	
1503	neg	Only issue I have with it is that I'll accidentally hit the mode switch and have to cycle back to the correct mode for whatever I'm doing	
1504	neg	The right click is failing to respond when pressed, it is hit or miss if it will activate upon clicking	
1506	neg	Wouldn't work without proprietary software (never mentioned, support team told me about it) and this week they pushed an update	
1508	neg	I physically can't scroll after owning it for not even two years	
1510	neg	BUT, after not even using it that long, the left click sometimes isn't responding to my click	
1517	neg	This makes it pretty much unusable	
1517	neg	Broke after a couple months of ordering it	
1525	neg	I bought this mouse in March, and played COD for 3 month, and then it's defected, primary click can't hold, means I can't shot anymore	
1525	neg	Very pool quality	
1528	neg	Buttons stopped working well and the clicks were super annoying	
1529	neg	Bought this mouse to hopefully end a cycle of replacing cheap mice with other cheap mice that wear out just as fast, but this mouse failed even faster	
1529	neg	That alone makes this mouse impossible to recommend, but it's also uncomfortable to hold	
1536	neg	But it's just way too heavy	
1543	neg	I got this around 8 months ago and the left click sometimes doesn't work and sometimes it double clicks really fast, my razor last like 3+ years everything else it's fine but durability is not one of them	
1545	neg	The mouse worked perfectly up until recently, one of the side buttons and the left mouse click have been getting stuck and are having issues holding	
1553	neg	It is far too sensitive and makes accidental bumps a common occurrence	
1562	neg	It was a great mouse for about 6 months, and then it started double clicking during games and getting me killed	
1565	neg	left clicker wore out really quickly	
1567	neg	Those saying that Logitech quality has fallen off are absolutely right	
1567	neg	Paid almost $55 for this one and in 4 months the buttons are randomly not clicking, double clicking, and letting go halfway through a drag	
1567	neg	Very disappointing	
1569	neg	Trash mouse with trash double click problem after 5 months just like trash razer mice, so annoying	
1570	neg	The mouse is bound to fail there is a know issue with the switches they use	
1570	neg	mine failed after 1 and a half years	
1571	neg	The slides went bad on my first one after a year of use	
1571	neg	And my second one the slides went bad after one month	
1579	neg	Just this last week, I was no longer able to hold right-click	
1580	neg	It was great for the first week but then the scroll wheel stopped working	
1600	neg	It's just not comfortable	
1600	neg	I've used many mouses since the 90s and this is one of the least comfortable I've touched	
1600	neg	You can't easily do the lift, it doesn't work well on many surfaces	
1602	neg	Mouse didn't last very long	
1602	neg	As for this one, problems arose not even 3 months later	
1602	neg	The mouse was giving me problems such as double clicking, not clicking, and getting stuck	
1602	neg	The mouse finally gave out, and the left mouse button broke off and is completely unusable	
1604	neg	The mouse has started double-clicking (2 clicks for the price of one)	
1604	neg	This is pretty disappointing since Logitech is known for its longevity, and I'm well past the return period	
1611	neg	every single button on the mouse (left, right, middle, and all of the side buttons) started to double/triple click on a single press after a couple months of use	
1611	neg	customer support and the warranty i got were entirely useless, so now I just have a broken brick of a mouse that i can't return/replace or use	
1613	neg	However, a major issue that I have with the mouse is it randomly disconnects when I’m using it	
1614	neg	This mouse started having double click issues and issues with not being able to drag and drop items after about one month randomly, as time went on it became consistent	
1616	neg	The absolutely horrible switches will only last you a matter of months	
1619	neg	At first it seemed great, but just after a few months, the left click button becomes inconsistently activated, which not only aggravated day to day work, but makes high stakes FPS not feasible for the hardcore gamers	
1622	neg	Bought June 2019, in roughly a year the house has begun to double click, I can’t recommend based on how quickly it broke down	
1624	neg	HOWEVER, this double clicking is a major issue	
1629	neg	If you wanna waste your money I'm some thing, This the right thing	
1629	neg	Suddenly, it started to miss clicks, from both buttons	
1629	neg	The cursor started to miss the point click precision and finally it stopped working, just like that	
1633	neg	I love the mouse it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are in convenient spots but the accidental double clicking ruins any type of consistency for gaming and also navigating web pages and such its just annoying	
1644	neg	I want to like this, but the driver applications they make you install DOES NOT WORK on the Apple M1 laptop	
1645	neg	I’ve only had this thing for a couple months now and every 5-10 minutes while using the Logitech program it gives me a “ backend connection issues “ I have tried ever vacant slot on my pc to no avail	
1645	neg	This is very annoying and I expected more from a high end mouse I spent my money on	
1645	neg	I wasted a lot of money on this and got screwed in the long run	
1646	neg	Right mouse button sticks causing delays	
1647	neg	I haven't opened the mouse and the box it self is old and oily i think i got a used version	
1660	neg	you dont want this mouse it's trash	
1664	neg	I then bought the G502 HERO to replace it and in less than a year the same issue happened	
1664	neg	Right Mouse button fails on click, for gaming specifically it sucks massively	
1665	neg	Only dislike is that I'm not a fan of the weird rubber/svelte material that your thumb rests on, the feel is strange and neither slippery or sticky, somewhat fails to have friction with the thumb	
1668	neg	These mice suck and the middle mouse click is trash	
1670	neg	The right click does not hold down at random times and support is useless	
1672	neg	Awful quality	
1675	neg	The buttons were double-clicking when I barely held them down and was making it impossible to play most games	
1675	neg	I had to manually take apart the mouse and fix the switches	
1676	neg	Very confusing button	
1676	neg	Not recommend for gaming, I play FPS game most of time and it made me very uncomfortable	
1679	neg	This is the 2nd Logitech mouse I've had where the right mouse button stopped working correctly	
1679	neg	Garbage product	
1679	neg	Find another brand, this one is terrible	
1681	neg	After using it almost daily for about  2 months I'm getting constant double clicks	
1681	neg	Seeing as I use this for gaming this has been a major pain	
1681	neg	I've read this problem a lot with this mouse, good size, but bad clicks	
1682	neg	after 3 months a button stopped working, I do not recommend it for games	
1684	neg	The mouse feet is cut to the edge an unsticking an the click on the mouse works on an off this is very bad I cant even use it anymore an I jus got bought it recently	
1685	neg	Mouse didn't last long	
1685	neg	it started having really bad double click issues after only a few months, I would avoid it	
1686	neg	But in intense gaming situations the mouse wheel would rattle causing issues in aiming	
1688	neg	I loved this mouse until the left click stopped working	
1688	neg	It happened pretty fast and will not hold down or allow you to drag and highlight	
1688	neg	Very annoying for work and gaming	
1690	neg	I don’t know why but the scroll wheel breaks so freakin easily for no reason	
1691	neg	Within the first month an issue with the left click double clicking began	
1691	neg	Then the issues with GHub started	
1691	neg	If it weren't for these issues I'd be happy with it, but unfortunately it's trash and I won't be buying another Logitech product	
1692	neg	I just dont like the mouse scroll design	
1695	neg	its now 100% unusable	
1695	neg	highly disappointed in this mouse, it should have lasted far longer for being an 80$ mouse	
1718	neg	Mouse is used, has dirt, smudges, and the wheel seems wobbly	
1724	neg	The mouse wheel seems loose and clicks on it's own when I move the mouse too quick and the pads on the bottom are bubbling and not in good shape	
1724	neg	Would not recommend and am very disappointed with the product	
1726	neg	This was a 5/5 star mouse for me until it developed the double clicking issue after only a month	
1726	neg	It happens quite consistently now, making me paranoid whenever using it which makes it now useless to me	
1729	neg	It became a real issue when trying to play games and needed to hold down the button	
1733	neg	Very disappointed as my last 4 mice have been logitech	
1739	neg	Complete junk	
1742	neg	After you use the scroll wheel, there's like a 50% chance the scroll wheel reverses once afterward	
1742	neg	Maybe I just have a defective model, either way it's terrible	
1749	neg	Just like some other dude here mentioned, I had the same problem	
1749	neg	Dented box, fingerprints on the weights, strong smell of them being oiled and scratches all over the mouse - not cool at all considering I paid the full price of 80$ and got something renewed and used which is worth 40$ at best	
1749	neg	Absolutely disappointing	
1751	neg	As of this week, about 9 months in, started experiencing issues with double clicking	
1758	neg	Idk why everyone loves this mouse, at least to me it feels really weird in hand and not the most optimal gaming mouse out there	
1759	neg	Mouse lasted for barely over half a year before succumbing to the infamous "double click & drag" disease	
1761	neg	The material for thumb rest is very difficult to clean and easy to destroy	
1762	neg	This thing which is simply spin out of control, pin the mouse to the top of the screen, or the bottom of the screen and really mess up your orientation at random	
1767	neg	The hand gets tired quickly, the wrist hurts after gaming or working with graphics	
1773	neg	so, i have had major issues with the click and click and drag	
1783	neg	Disappointing to pay $40 and not all parts work	
1787	neg	Left clicking and holding to drag are not working	
1787	neg	This mouse was bought four months ago today and now does not work	
1789	neg	It actually hurt my hand on the very first day since the mouse is a lot bigger than normal sizes	
1789	neg	When my hand finally adapted to it, then the wheel broke within 2 weeks of use	
1790	neg	I purchased this mouse 6-7 months ago, two months ago it started to randomly double click	
1802	neg	It's still kinda usable, but the unintentional double clicks can be annoying and actually quite dangerous	
1818	neg	Left click stopped working	
1818	neg	I can’t click and hold since the hold only registers intermittently	
1818	neg	Piece of garbage now	
1821	neg	Pain in the rear mouse	
1821	neg	Cant drag anything around my screen anymore	
1821	neg	Logitech like other brands seem to be going downhill in design	
1824	neg	mouse wheel did not last a month	
1824	neg	a waste of my money	
1830	neg	However, the left mouse button started double clicking randomly regardless of the computer it was used on	
1830	neg	This is a known issue with logitech mice	
1840	neg	But after a while of using it, I noticed that it kept hiccuping, like the cursor on the screen would stop while I was moving the mouse, this proved very difficult to deal with since it refused to move at one point while I was playing a game	
1840	neg	A waste of 50 bucks	
1846	neg	Disappointed that the left click of the mouse stopped working properly after a year's use	
1847	neg	It's hard to hold with my massive hands and the set up is anoyingly hard to do	
1856	neg	it's a pain	
1862	neg	Just less than a month with using it not that much and suddenly the middle wheel button is not clicking anymore and it's broken
